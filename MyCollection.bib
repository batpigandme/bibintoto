abstract = {Relationship marketing (RM) is about retaining customers through the achieve- ment of long-term mutual satisfaction by businesses and their customers. Sport organizations, to retain customers by establishing, maintaining, and enhancing relationships, need to communicate and engage in dialogue with their customers. To achieve this on an ongoing basis, sport organizations need to employ effective communication platforms. In this regard, social media (SM) is becoming an ideal tool for a continuing 2-way dialogue. However, the effects of SM, primarily in terms of addressing RM goals, are not yet well understood. This study explores the opportunities and challenges facing managers in sport organizations in using SM in an RM strategy. Eight case studies were undertaken on organizations that put on running events. The article presents the findings on the use, opportunities, and challenges of SM and recommendations encouraging continued investigation.},

abstract = {Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a powerful method for modeling data associated with pairwise relationships, finding use in collaborative filtering, computational biology, and document analysis, among other areas. In many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction. For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information. We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game are relevant for the outcome.},

abstract = {Topic modeling, a method of statistically extracting thematic content from a large collection of texts, is used for a wide variety of tasks within text analysis. Though there are a growing number of tools and techniques for exploring single models, comparisons between models are generally reduced to a small set of numerical metrics. These metrics may or may not reflect a model's performance on the analyst's intended task, and can therefore be insufficient to diagnose what causes differences between models. In this paper, we explore task-centric topic model comparison, considering how we can both provide detail for a more nuanced understanding of differences and address the wealth of tasks for which topic models are used. We derive comparison tasks from single-model uses of topic models, which predominantly fall into the categories of understanding topics, understanding similarity, and understanding change. Finally, we provide several visualization techniques that facilitate these tasks, including buddy plots, which combine color and position encodings to allow analysts to readily view changes in document similarity.},

abstract = {We propose a framework to describe, analyze, and explain the conditions under which scientific communities organize themselves to do research, particularly within large-scale, multidisciplinary projects. The framework centers on the notion of a research repertoire, which encompasses well-aligned assemblages of the skills, behaviors, and material, social, and epistemic components that a group may use to practice certain kinds of science, and whose enactment affects the methods and results of research. This account provides an alternative to the idea of Kuhnian paradigms for understanding scientific change in the following ways: (1) it does not frame change as primarily generated and shaped by theoretical developments, but rather takes account of administrative, material, technological, and institutional innovations that contribute to change and explicitly questions whether and how such innovations accompany, underpin, and/or undercut theoretical shifts; (2) it thus allows for tracking of the organization, continuity, and coherence in research practices which Kuhn characterized as ???normal science??? without relying on the occurrence of paradigmatic shifts and revolutions to be able to identify relevant components; and (3) it requires particular attention be paid to the performative aspects of science, whose study Kuhn pioneered but which he did not extensively conceptualize. We provide a detailed characterization of repertoires and discuss their relationship with communities, disciplines, and other forms of collaborative activities within science, building on an analysis of historical episodes and contemporary developments in the life sciences, as well as cases drawn from social and historical studies of physics, psychology, and medicine.},

We develop an econometric model to determine if there is a momentum effect in the NBA by examining how success over the past few games leads to a higher probability of winning the next game. The model takes into account the home vs. away strengths of the teams in the current game as well as their opponents in the previous games (to calculate measures of “adjusted success over the past few games”). Thus, success in previous games is adjusted for quality of the wins or losses. In addition, we account for rest days before the current game for both teams. Using data over three NBA seasons (2007-2009), we find strong evidence for a positive momentum effect.},

abstract = {Significant work has gone into the development of team and individual statistics in the NBA; for example, the team measures of the "Four Factors." Less work has been conducted using multivariate analyses of these metrics, including identifying possible new statistical techniques to analyze these data. In particular, this research examines the feasibility of using structural equation modeling (SEM) for multivariate analyses of NBA Four Factors data. SEM consists of both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path modeling. Before SEM is employed, this research first examines the effects of offensive and defensive Four Factors in a linear regression model, expanding previous research and providing a baseline for the SEM. In doing so, the data show the importance of effective field goal percentage. Next, structural equation modeling is employed. The CFA finds that offensive Four Factors are indicators of a single latent factor, labeled "offensive quality." The "defensive quality" latent factor is estimable when replacing opposing teams' free throw rate with steals per possession. The SEM is extended to regress winning percentage on latent offensive and defensive quality as well as salary. Salary is an important and often overlooked part of multivariate models examining team statistics, but it is easily incorporated in SEM. The explained variance for the regression in the SEM is similar to that of the linear regression model and indicates the importance of both offensive and defensive quality, with offensive quality having a larger effect. Team salaries are related to offensive quality, but not defensive quality or winning. As such, a second structural equation model is proposed where the effect of salary on winning is mediated by its relationship with offensive and defensive quality. Since salary is related to offensive quality but not defensive quality, and offensive quality is more important to winning percentage, this suggests that money spent is done so for offensive performance and affects winning through the performance paid for. These results suggest potential team strategies, as well as the applicability of SEM to sports analytics, not only to NBA data, but to other sports data as well. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Statistical Association.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate cognitive and emotional factors associated with the presence and clinical course of confabulation. 24 confabulating participants were compared with 11 brain injured and 6 healthy controls on measures of temporal context confusions (TCC), mood state (elation, depression) and lack of insight. Measures of autobiographical memory and executive function were also available. Changes in confabulation and these other measures were monitored over 9 months in the confabulating group. We found that TCC were more common in confabulating patients than in healthy controls, and that the decline in these errors paralleled the recovery from confabulation. However, TCC were not specific to the presence of confabulation in brain injury; and their decline was not correlated with change in confabulation scores over 9 months. We found that elated mood and lack of insight discriminated between confabulating and non-confabulating patients, but these measures did not correlate with either the severity of confabulation or change in confabulation scores through time. What seems to have been most strongly associated with the severity of confabulation scores at ‘baseline' and changes through time (over 9 months) were the severity of memory impairment (especially on autobiographical memory) and errors on executive tests (particularly in making cognitive estimates). Greater autobiographical memory and executive impairment were associated with more severe confabulation. The findings were consistent with the view that confabulation results from executive dysfunction where autobiographical memory is also impaired; and that it resolves as these impairments subside.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In terms of actions, subjects think they would do their perceived duty rather than violate it for the sake of better consequences. The discrepancy between duty and judged consequences does not seem to result from self-interest alone. When asked for reasons, many subjects felt an obligation to help their fellow citizens before others, and they also thought that they owed something to their nation, in return for what it did for them. The obligation to help fellow citizens was the strongest predictor of perceived duty. In an experiment with Israeli and Palestinian students, group membership affected both perceived overall consequences and duty, but the effect of group on perceived consequences did not account for the effect on perceived duty.},

In contrast to Keller's proposed model, relationships between the brand image's components were discovered. Thus, in line with means-end theory, a brand-image model should incorporate causalities among brand attributes, benefits, and attitudes. Fan loyalty is positively influenced by a fan's brand attitude. Relationships among the brand-image dimensions and loyalty are confirmed via structural equation modeling. The non-product-related brand attributes (i.e., logo or tradition) have a particularly large impact on attitudes and behavior. They represent promising starting points for a successful and differentiating team brand strategy.},

Several past studies have modeled this relationship for the games played during the March Madness tournament, and this work aims at verifying if the models advocated in these papers still perform well for regular season games. Indeed, most previous articles have shown that a simple quadratic regression model provides fairly accurate predictions of the margin of victory when team rankings only range from 1 to 16. Does that still hold true when team rankings can go as high as 351? Do the model assumptions hold? Can we find semi- or non-parametric methods that yield even better results (i.e. predicted margins of victory that more closely resemble actual results)? The analyses presented in this paper suggest that the answer is "yes" on all three counts!},

@article{Beck2003,
abstract = {How can one distinguish the concept of second modernity from the concept of postmodernity? Postmodernists are interested in deconstruction without reconstruction, second modernity is about deconstruction and reconstruction. Social sciences need to construct new concepts to understand the world dynamics at the beginning of the 21st century. Modernity has not vanished, we are not post it. Radical social change has always been part of modernity. What is new is that modernity has begun to modernize its own foundations. This is what it means to say modernity has become reflexive. It has become directed at itself. This causes huge new problems both in reality and in theory. There has been a pluralization of the boundaries within and between societies, between society and nature, between Us and Other, between life and death. This pluralization also changes the inherent nature of boundaries. They become not so much boundaries as a variety of attempts to draw of boundaries. Border conflicts become transformed into conflicts over the drawing of boundaries. Where postmodernism simply celebrates this multiplication of boundaries, the theory of second modernity starts with the problem this new reality poses for individual and collective decisions, and with the problem that the continued existence of such decisions poses for theory. Institutions that are capable of such conscious boundary drawing are enabled in a way that those of the first modernity were not. But this process also generates qualitatively new kinds of trouble and crises. To investigate those troubles is to unveil the emergence of the second modernity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

This paper presents a framework for understanding how and why consumers engage in relationship marketing. Based on Kelman's functional approach to attitude change, this framework presents three qualitatively different levels for understanding relationship formation and maintenance: (a) compli- ance is superficial, temporary, and often the result of external influence; (b) identification is related to self- esteem and image enhancement of sport consumers; and (c) internalization is the result of values similarity. Internalization is more likely to result in a long-term relationship.},

There are many possible sources of errors that could jeopardise these efforts, such as measurement or simulation errors in the pre-analysis stage, or errors generated in the visualization process itself. Our focus here is to control errors introduced during the visualization processes. To this end we propose a conceptual model for visualization known as the Model Centred Approach (MCA). This new paradigm separates the modelling and viewing processes in visualization, and this provides the opportunity to consistently utilise a single modelling function throughout the visualization process. Results show that consistent visualizations are produced by our approach when compared to conventional methods.},

abstract = {In order to identify the nature of journalism knowledge, I consider it basic to begin with the simplest questions: where do the issues which motivate the theories of journalism come from? What is the position of the journalism study field within the Social Sciences? The point of view which places the production of scientific knowledge in a hermeneutic circle seems appropriate for dealing with these questions. For three reasons: a) because it transforms science – strange and distant – into something familiar and close at hand, which, not speaking the everyday language, is capable of communicating to us its discoveries and its limits; b) because it considers the production of knowledge to be a social practice which is carried out through dialogue with the world; and c) because it teaches us that we cannot comprehend any of the parts (the "discoveries" of the different disciplines) unless we have some comprehension of how the whole "works" and vice versa, we cannot comprehend the entirety unless we have some comprehension of how its parts "work". The hermeneutic reflection, therefore, seeks to transform the abstract in the letters written by Voltaire, Juan Luis Cebri{\'{a}}n and alberto Dines, i find a wisdom originating from experience which is transformed into knowledge for the practice of the profession. in this wisdom there are signs that journalism dialogues with the disciplines of the social sciences and of language, at the same time that their authors point out the issues which will be transformed into the subject for study according to the theories of journalism. From the wisdom of experience to scientific practice and from the latter to the practice of the profession there is a circulation of knowledge which, in this article, i place in the perspective of the hermeneutic circle indicated by Boaventura de souza santos.},

Consequently, one would expect information to be processed efficiently in this industry.

This study of decision making in the National Basketball Association (NBA) begins with a literature review that indicates players can score a major payday by simply focusing on scoring. Beyond this review, we offer an empirical investigation of both the voting for the All-Rookie team and the determination of player salary that clearly indicates that the ability to accumulate points dominates player evaluation in the NBA. Given that such a focus is not consistent with winning games or maximizing profits, we argue that decision-makers in the NBA do not behave according to the dictates of instrumental rationality.},

Indeed, it is becoming more and more evident that research is increasingly being mediated through digital technology. Many argue that this mediation is slowly beginning to change what it means to undertake research, affecting both the epistemologies and ontologies that underlie a research programme. Of course, this development is variable depending on disciplines and research agendas, with some more reliant on digital technology than others, but it is rare to find an academic today who has had no access to digital technology as part of their research activity. Library catalogues are now probably the minimum way in which an academic can access books and research articles without the use of a computer, but, with card indexes dying a slow and certain death (Baker, 1996, 2001), there remain few outputs for the non-digital scholar to undertake research in the modern university. Email, Google searches and bibliographic databases are become increasingly crucial, as more of the world libraries are scanned and placed online. Whilst some decry the loss of the skills and techniques of older research traditions, others have warmly embraced what has come to be called the digital humanities (Schreibman et al., 2008; Schnapp {\&} Presner, 2009; Presner, 2010; Hayles,},

In a number of recent papers, different quality metrics are proposed to automate the demanding search through large spaces of alternative visualizations (e.g., alternative projections or ordering), allowing the user to concentrate on the most promising visualizations suggested by the quality metrics. Over the last decade, this approach has witnessed a remarkable development but few reflections exist on how these methods are related to each other and how the approach can be developed further. For this purpose, we provide an overview of approaches that use quality metrics in high-dimensional data visualization and propose a systematization based on a thorough literature review. We carefully analyze the papers and derive a set of factors for discriminating the quality metrics, visualization techniques, and the process itself. The process is described through a reworked version of the well-known information visualization pipeline. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by applying it to several existing approaches that use quality metrics, and we provide reflections on implications of our model for future research.},

The study uses a probability-based survey of Americans where half received questions about nanotechnology and half received nearly identical questions about nuclear energy. Overall, it shows that the 'standard' predictors of technology support - risk/benefit perceptions, familiarity, and views about decision-makers - are similar for both nanotechnology and nuclear energy but that lower familiarity may also result in less ability for these variables to statistically explain support for nanotechnology. The data provide only partial evidence that citizens meaningfully differentiate between the two very different technologies, and the patterns of results lend support to the theory that generalized views about science and science decision-makers - in addition to issue-specific concerns - are central to understanding opinion dynamics involving emerging technologies like nanotechnology.},

Data were collected among fans of a professional soccer team, and the results of a structural equation model provide evidence that attitudinal loyalty impacts the attitude toward both sponsors and purchase intentions. Behavioral loyalty influences sponsorship awareness, and impacts differently the attitude and purchase intentions toward each sponsor. Sponsorship awareness influences significantly the attitude toward both sponsors, while the attitude toward the sponsor was the strongest predictor of purchase intentions. These findings highlight the importance of examining actual sponsors and suggest managerial implications, such as the need for sponsors to help attract fans to the stadium and to design additional activation strategies to improve sponsorship value.

@article{Blischak2016,
abstract = {Many scientists write code as part of their research. Just as expriments are logged in laboratory notebooks, it is important to document the code you use for analysis. However, a few key problems can arise when iteratively developing code that make it difficult to document and track which code version was used to create each result. First, you often need to experiment with new ideas, such as adding new features to a script or increasing the speed of a slow step, but you do not want to risk breaking the currently working code. One often-utilized solution is to make a copy of the script before making new edits. However, this can quickly become a problem because it clutters your file system with uninformative filenames, e.g., analisys.sh, analysis{\_}02.sh, analysis{\_}03.sh, etc. It is difficult to remember the differences between the verions of the files and, more importantly, which version you used to produce specific results, especially if you return to the code months later. Second, you will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators, and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes of them sends. Fortunately, software engineers have already developed software to manage these issues: version control. A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the iterative changes you make to your code, Thus, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results. Furthermore, you can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. It also facilitates collaboration. Using a VCS, your collaborators can make and save changes to the code, and you can automatically incorporate these changes to the main code base. The collaborative aspect is enhanced with the emergence of websites that host version-controlled code.},

This study investigates college students' use of multiple distribution systems in the context of sports. More specifically, the relative importance of Twitter in relation to television is assessed. In addition, variables potentially predicting a greater reliance on Twitter are analyzed. Results indicate that television remains the primary distribution system for sports and that the importance of Twitter might have been overstated. The use of social media does not diminish the consumption of traditional sports broadcasts but is positively correlated. Finally, results of a regression analysis find that a subset of individuals is more likely to rely on Twitter depending on their tendency to engage in parasocial interactions, their Twitter use patterns, and their perceived expertise in sports.},

abstract = {Accounting for undecided and uncertain voters is a challenging issue for predicting election results from public opinion polls. Undecided voters typify the uncertainty of swing voters in polls but are often ignored or allocated to each candidate in a simplistic manner. Historically this has been adequate because first, the undecided tend to settle on a candidate as the election day draws closer, and second, they are comparatively small enough to assume that the undecided voters do not affect the relative proportions of the decided voters. These assumptions are used by poll authors and meta-poll analysts, but in the presence of high numbers of undecided voters these static rules may bias election predictions. In this paper, we examine the effect of undecided voters in the 2016 US presidential election. This election was unique in that a) there was a relatively high number of undecided voters and b) the major party candidates had high unfavorability ratings. We draw on psychological theories of decision making such as decision field theory and prospect theory to explain the link between candidate unfavorability and voter indecisiveness, and to describe how these factors likely contributed to a systematic bias in polling. We then show that the allocation of undecided voters in the 2016 election biased polls and meta-polls in a manner consistent with these theories. These findings imply that, given the increasing number of undecided voters in recent elections, it will be important to take into account the underlying psychology of voting when making predictions about elections.},

Visualization research has often overlooked the errors and uncertainty which accompany the scientific process and describe key characteristics used to fully understand the data. The lack of these representations can be attributed, in part, to the inherent difficulty in defining, characterizing, and controlling this uncertainty, and in part, to the difficulty in including additional visual metaphors in a well designed, potent display. However, the exclusion of this information cripples the use of visualization as a decision making tool due to the fact that the display is no longer a true representation of the data. This systematic omission of uncertainty commands fundamental research within the visualization community to address, integrate, and expect uncertainty information. In this chapter, we outline sources and models of uncertainty, give an overview of the state-of-the-art, provide general guidelines, outline small exemplary applications, and finally, discuss open problems in uncertainty visualization.},

abstract = {On the surface it appears as if Hannah Arendt has said little on hermeneutics or place. Yet she provides insights into ways of thinking about space and place, once we recover the way her approach overlaps with a particular kind of hermeneutics, the phenomenological hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer. In that light, place and space can be seen as unspecified resources for her theorizing. For example, for Arendt the reality of the public realm is dependent on the simultaneous presence of innumerable perspectives. The public object is realized when many spectators, from their different locations see “sameness in utter diversity.” This is a reality that comes into being not through abolishing different spatial locations but rather by multiplying them. Multi-perspectivism, the need for many spectators to be differently located, or even more strongly, for one spectator to think through the many perspectives on an object from their own position, provides a way to recognize her unarticulated contributions to space and place. With a primary focus on The Human Condition, this chapter addresses the formulation of the modern decline in a sense of place as articulated by Casey and Aug{\'{e}} as overlapping with the decline in the public realm as articulated by Arendt. Both can be treated as instances of world alienation. The chapter goes on to articulate the way Arendt's tri-partite division of labor, work and action offer ways of rehabilitating the concept of space from its modern sense of immensity to a formulation of ways that space and place, world and polis, can dialectically support each other. To develop these conceptions of place and space, it is argued, is simultaneously to develop a sense of what multi-perspectivism looks like},

The relevant elements of the T-pattern detection process are explained and exemplar data from the analysis of 13 soccer matches are presented to highlight the potential of this form of analysis.

This study examined differences in Black and White students' experiences of school climate and explored whether indicators of school organizational health and staff burnout moderated differences in students' school experiences by race. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling with a sample of 18,397 Black students (n = 6228) and White students (n = 12,169) and 2391 school staff in 53 schools, we found a consistent pattern of racial inequalities, such that Black students reported less positive experiences than White students across three indicators of school climate (caring ?? = -0.08, p {\textless} .001; equity ?? = -0.05, p = .007; and engagement ?? = -0.05, p {\textless} .001). In addition, we found significant, positive associations between aggregated staff-report of school organizational health and student-reported school climate (e.g., staff affiliation and student-perceived equity, ?? = 0.07, p {\textless} .001). Surprisingly, a number of school organizational health indicators were more strongly associated with positive perceptions of school climate among White students than Black students, translating into greater racial disparities in perceived school climate at schools with greater organizational health (e.g., supportive leadership by race on student-perceived engagement, ?? = - 0.03, p = .042). We also found negative associations between staff-reported burnout and students' experience of equity, such that the racial gap was smaller in schools with high ratings of burnout (?? = 0.04, p = .002). These findings have implications for educators and education researchers interested in promoting school social contexts that equitably support student engagement and success.},

abstract = {The effect of sponsorship on the stock market returns of the sponsoring companies has been previously studied, but the internationalizing aspect of sponsorship has been overlooked. We examine returns to shareholders for firms sponsoring international football matches using an event study analysis. We find that there are cumula­ tive abnormal returns to stockholders of sponsoring firms of international matches 10 days after the match and 20 days after the match. This finding is robust across several different event-study methods. We also find this general pattern across different professional football leagues, as well as a positive effect on returns by sponsoring high-profile football clubs. We theorize that the elapsed time until the effect on the stock price is the result of building brand awareness before a shift in the price becomes evident. These findings add nuance to the literature on sponsorship and event studies, which is almost exclusively domestic in character.},

abstract = {The authors empirically tested Underwood, Bond, and Baer's (2001) social identity–brand equity (SIBE) model in the context of fans of a university men's basketball team. Their model proposes that service marketplace characteristics (venue, team history, rituals, and social groups) enhance one's social identity to a team. This heightened social identity, in turn, is seen to build brand equity of the team brand. Using the SIBE model as a conceptual framework, a comparative study was conducted across 3 distinct fan groups of the team: current students, alumni, and the general public. Results provide strong support for the effect of social identity on brand equity; regardless of the type of fan, a heightened social identity to the team enhanced the perceived equity of the athletic program (i.e., brand) overall. How social identity was formed, however, differed by fan group. For example, team history showed a significant relationship to social identity for alumni and the general public. Students were most influenced by their sense of the basketball program being part of the local community as a whole. These finding are valuable in knowing how to craft marketing communications for various fan constituencies, as well as understanding how identification to 1 team might be leveraged across all sports in a collegiate athletic program.},

abstract = {Could changing the locations of polling places affect the outcome of an election by increasing the costs of voting for some and decreasing them for others? The consolidation of voting precincts in Los Angeles County during California's 2003 gubernatorial recall election provides a natural experiment for studying how changing polling places influences voter turnout. Overall turnout decreased by a substantial 1.85 percentage points: A drop in polling place turnout of 3.03 percentage points was partially offset by an increase in absentee voting of 1.18 percentage points. Both transportation and search costs caused these changes. Although there is no evidence that the Los Angeles Registrar of Voters changed more polling locations for those registered with one party than for those registered with another, the changing of polling places still had a small partisan effect because those registered as Democrats were more sensitive to changes in costs than those registered as Republicans. The effects were small enough to allay worries about significant electoral consequences in this instance (e.g., the partisan effect might be decisive in only about one in two hundred contested House elections), but large enough to make it possible for someone to affect outcomes by more extensive manipulation of polling place locations.},

abstract = {Why do people visualize data? People visualize data either to consume or produce information relevant to a domain-specific problem or interest. Visualization design and evaluation involves a mapping between domain problems or interests and appropriate visual encoding and interaction design choices. This mapping translates a domain-specific situation into abstract visualization tasks, which allows for succinct descriptions of tasks and task sequences in terms of why data is visualized, what dependencies a task might have in terms of input and output, and how the task is supported in terms of visual encoding and interaction design choices. Describing tasks in this way facilitates the comparison and cross-pollination of visualization design choices across application domains; the mapping also applies in reverse, whenever visualization researchers aim to contextualize novel visualization techniques. In this dissertation, we present multiple instances of visualization task abstraction, each integrating our proposed typology of abstract visualization tasks. We apply this typology as an analysis tool in an interview study of individuals who visualize dimensionally reduced data in different application domains, in a post-deployment field study evaluation of a visual analysis tool in the domain of investigative journalism, and in a visualization design study in the domain of energy management. In the interview study, we draw upon and demonstrate the descriptive power of our typology to classify five task sequences relating to visualizing dimensionally reduced data. This classification is intended to inform the design of new tools and techniques for visualizing this form of data. In the field study, we draw upon and demonstrate the descriptive and evaluative power of our typology to evaluate Overview, a visualization tool for investigating large text document collections. After analyzing its adoption by investigative journalists, we characterize two abstract tasks relating to document mining and present seven lessons relating to the design of visualization tools for document data. In the design study, we demonstrate the descriptive, evaluative, and generative power of our typology and identify matches and mismatches between visualization design choices and three abstract tasks relating to time series data. Finally, we reflect upon the impact of our task typology.},

abstract = {The considerable previous work characterizing visualization usage has focused on low-level tasks or interactions and high-level tasks, leaving a gap between them that is not addressed. This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classification systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.},

From a theoretical point of view, sports betting products may be superior to a fixed rate investment because of heterogeneous expectations, risk-loving behavior of investors or additional non-monetary utility components. In comparison to the direct placement of bets at bookmakers', sports betting products may be preferable in cases of hedonic framing. Our experimental section, however, reveals the limited practical relevance of these theoretical arguments for "average" decision makers. Despite this, financial instruments with sports betting components offer a certain profit potential due to the diversity of preferences across individuals. Summarizing, the issuance of sports betting products may actually be mainly driven by marketing aspects, nevertheless sports betting products may be considered to be "viable" niche products with low cost of capital for banks. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The use of spatial analytics in basketball is becoming more common with the installation of optical tracking devices in all arenas. However, much of the statistical work done on spatial data to date has focused solely on descriptive aspects of the data, thereby providing only basic insights from spatial analytics. This paper presents a predictive Bayesian Belief Network model that uses spatial shooting data to determine optimal shooting zones on a basketball court given exogenous variables, such as the quality of the opposing team or the day of the week on which a game is played, and game data, such as team assists or blocks. The model reveals that regardless of the exogenous variables observed, winning probability is maximized when shooting from under the basket, 3-pointers from the corners and, to a lesser extent, 2-pointers from the corners. Increasing winning probability by shooting from under the basket is a logical and unsurprising finding due to the high number of shots taken per game from this zone and their high conversion percentage, and therefore receives limited attention in this paper. However, the increased winning probability derived from corner shots is an interesting result that could be attributed to the shorter distance of these shots to the hoop, or to a “drive and dish” type play in which shots from these zones face less defensive pressure.},

Recently the visualization community has risen to the challenge of incorporating an indication of uncertainty into visual representations, and in this article we review their work. We place the work in the context of a reference model for data visualization, that sees data pass through a pipeline of processes. This allows us to distinguish the visualization of uncertainty —which considers how we depict uncertainty specified with the data—and the uncertainty of visualization —which considers how much inaccuracy occurs as we process data through the pipeline. It has taken some time for uncertain visualization methods to be developed, and we explore why uncertainty visualization is hard—one explanation is that we typically need to find another display dimension and we may have used these up already! To organize the material we return to a typology developed by one of us in the early days of visualization, and make use of this to present a catalog of visualization techniques describing the research that has been done to extend each method to handle uncertainty. Finally we note the responsibility on us all to incorporate any known uncertainty into a visualization, so that integrity of the discipline is maintained.},

abstract = {In the sports of soccer, hockey and basketball the most commonly used statistics for player performance assessment are divided into two categories: offensive statistics and defensive statistics. However, qualitative assessments of playmaking (for example, making “smart” passes) are difficult to quantify. It would be advantageous to have available a single statistic that can emphasize the flow of a game, rewarding those players who initiate and contribute to successful plays more. In this paper we will examine a model based on Google's PageRank. Other papers have explored ranking teams, coaches, and captains but here we construct ratings and rankings for individual members on both teams in a game that emphasize initiating and partaking in successful plays and forcing defensive turnovers. For a soccer/hockey/basketball game, our model assigns a node for each of the n players who play in the game and a “goal node”. Arcs between player nodes indicate a pass in the reverse order (turnovers are dealt with separately). Every sport-specific situation (fouls, out-of-bounds, playstoppages, turnovers, missed shots, defensive plays) is addressed, tailored for each sport. As well, some additional arcs are added in to ensure that the associated Markov chain transition matrix is primitive (some power of the matrix has all positive entries) and hence there is a unique PageRank vector, which is used to rate and rank the players of the game. To illustrate the model, data was taken from nine NBA games played between 2014 and 2016. The application shows that this model does indeed provide the type of comprehensive statistic described in the introductory paragraph. Many of the top-ranked players (in the model) in a given game have some of the most impressive traditional stat-lines. However, from the model there are surprises where some players who have impressive stat-lines have lower ranks, and others, who have less impressive stat-lines have higher ranks. Overall, the model provides an alternate tool for player assessment in soccer, basketball and hockey. The model's ranking and ratings reflect more the flow of the game compared to traditional sports statistics.},

abstract = {The release of NBA player tracking data greatly enhances the granularity and dimensionality of basketball statistics used to evaluate and compare player performance. However, the high dimensionality of this new data source can be troublesome as it demands more computational resources and reduces the ability to easily interpret findings. Therefore, we must find a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the ability to differentiate and compare player performance. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify four principal components that account for 68{\%} of the variation in player tracking data from the 2013-2014 regular season and intuitive interpretations of these new dimensions are developed by examining the statistics that influence them the most. In this new high variance, low dimensional space, you can easily compare statistical profiles across any or all of the principal component dimensions to evaluate characteristics that make certain players and teams similar or unique. A simple measure of similarity between two player or team statistical profiles based on the four principal component scores is also constructed. The Statistical Diversity Index (SDI) allows for quick and intuitive comparisons using the entirety of the player tracking data. As new statistics emerge, this framework is scalable as it can incorporate existing and new data sources by reconstructing the principal component dimensions and SDI for improved comparisons. Using principal component scores and SDI, several use cases are presented for improved personnel management.},

However, the high dimensionality of this new data source can be troublesome as it demands more compu-tational resources and reduces the ability to easily analyze and interpret findings. To avoid such circumstances, we must find a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data set while retaining the ability to differentiate and compare player performance. In this paper Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify four principal com-ponents that account for over 70{\%} of the variation in player tracking data from the 2013-2014 regular season and intuitive interpretations of these new dimensions are developed by examining the statistics that influence them the most. In this new high variance, low dimensional space, you can easily compare player statistical profiles across any or all of the principal component dimensions to evaluate characteristics that make certain players similar or unique. We use the four principal component scores to construct a simple measure of the similarity between two player statistical profiles, the Statistical Diversity Index (SDI), and average this measure across all players on a team to produce a team level measure of the statistical diversity among its players, the team Statistical Diversity Index (tSDI). The tSDI is found to be positively correlated with winning percentage for the 2013-2014 regular season (p-value 0.01) indicating teams with higher statistical diversity among players generally hold higher winning percentages. We demonstrate potential applications using the prin-cipal component scores to better manage player personnel in terms of statistical diversity. The 2013-2014 Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers are evaluated to determine which dimen-sions they are lacking in statistical diversity and how their personnel changes impact statistical diversity along those dimensions.},

abstract = {The area of team performance analysis in Sport is ever growing. Compared to other sports, Rugby Union has, so far, seen little research in this regard. Currently, methods used to objectively depict team performance rely on expert users' analysis after the fact. We have devised a metric for capturing performance that brings experts users into the process earlier, thus creating a more meaningful performance metric. This scoring process uses Multi-Criteria Decision Making, and is verified by analysing 552 rugby matches over three seasons of the Celtic League and European Rugby Cup. We examine if the attributes of performance follow an underlying structure. We also ask if our method provides meaningful insight and we test if our model stands up to artificial intelligence, when it comes to forecasting match results. We find that this is indeed the case and conclude that our methodology provides a reasonable basis for both comparative performance analysis and strategy formulation.},

abstract = {Recent advances in 3D scanning technologies have opened new possibilities in a broad range of applications including cultural heritage, medicine, civil engineering, and urban planning. Virtual Reality systems can provide new tools to professionals that want to understand acquired 3D models. In this review paper, we analyze the concept of data comprehension with an emphasis on visualization and inspection tools on immersive setups. We claim that in most application fields, data comprehension requires model measurements, which in turn should be based on the explicit visualization of uncertainty. As 3D digital representations are not faithful, information on their fidelity at local level should be included in the model itself as uncertainty bounds. We propose the concept of Measurable 3D Models as digital models that explicitly encode such local uncertainty bounds. We claim that professionals and experts can strongly benefit from immersive interaction through new specific, fidelity-aware measurement tools, which can facilitate 3D data comprehension. Since noise and processing errors are ubiquitous in acquired datasets, we discuss the estimation, representation, and visualization of data uncertainty. We show that, based on typical user requirements in Cultural Heritage and other domains, application-oriented measuring tools in 3D models must consider uncertainty and local error bounds. We also discuss the requirements of immersive interaction tools for the comprehension of huge 3D and nD datasets acquired from real objects. Keywords:},

In particular, a lack of standard metrics for comparing communicative patterns across cases prevents researchers from developing a more comprehensive perspective on the diverse, sometimes crucial roles which hashtags play in Twitter-based communication. We address this problem by outlining a catalogue of widely applicable, standardised metrics for analysing Twitter-based communication, with particular focus on hashtagged exchanges. We also point to potential uses for such metrics, presenting an indication of what broader comparisons of diverse cases can achieve.},

@article{Brush1974,
abstract = {I suggest that the teacher who wants to indoctrinate his students in the traditional role of the scientist as a neutral fact finder should not use historical materials of the kind now being prepared by historians of science: they will not serve his purposes. He may wish to follow the advice of philosopher J. C. C. Smart, who recently suggested that it is legitimate to use fictionalized history of science to illustrate one's pronouncements on scientific method (56). On the other hand, those teachers who want to counteract the dogmatism of the textbooks and convey some understanding of science as an activity that cannot be divorced from metaphysical or esthetic considerations may find some stimulation in the new history of science. As historian D. S. L. Cardwell has argued (57, p. 120): . . . [I]f the history of science is to be used as an educational discipline, to inculcate an enlightened and critical mind, then the Whig view . . . cannot do this. For it must emphasize the continuities, the smooth and successive developments from one great achievement to the next and so on; and in doing so it must automatically endow the present state of science with all the immense authority of history. He suggests that the critical mind might be inhibited by seeing the present as the inevitable, triumphant product of the past. The history of science could aid the teaching of science by showing that "such puzzling concepts as force, energy, etc., are man-made and were evolved in an understandable sequence in response to acutely felt and very real problems. They were not handed down by some celestial textbook writer to whom they were immediately self-evident" (57, p. 120). The past may give some hints on how to survive the most recent recurrence of public hostility to science. Rather than blaming historians such as Kuhn for encouraging antiscientific attitudes, as one physicist did in a public address in 1972 (58), one might consider this criticism of the older style of science history, published in 1940 by W. James Lyons (59, p. 381): The historians of science are responsible, it would appear, for the unpopularity of science among those most acutely affected by the depression. In their clamor to enhance the scientific tradition, and hoard for science all credit for the remarkable and unprecedented material advances which studded the century and a quarter preceding 1930, these historians have been more enthusiastic than accurate . . . science emerged [in the popular mind] as the most prominent force responsible for making this modern world so startlingly different from all preceding ages. Thus when, for many people, the modern world, in spite of all its resources, began to slip from its role of "best of all imaginable worlds," science came in for a proportionate share of blame. Had a more accurate picture of the part science has played been presented, science would not now be the object of so much suspicion and resentment. In more recent times, hostility to science has been intensified by the image of the "objective," robot-like scientist lacking emotions and moral values. If the new approach to the history of science really does give a more realistic picture of the behavior of scientists, perhaps it has a "redeeming social significance." Then, rather than limiting the conception of science to the strict pattern allowed by traditional local standards, one might try to change those standards in such a way as to reflect the freedom that the boldest natural philosophers have always exercised.},

These visual representations of risk are grounded in empirically supported theory. As background, we first review research showing that people often have difficulty understanding numerical risks and benefits in health information. In particular, we discuss how understanding the meanings of numbers results in healthier decisions. Then, we discuss the processes that determine how communication of numerical risks can enhance (or degrade) health judgments and decisions. Specifically, we examine two different approaches to risk communication: a traditional approach and fuzzy-trace theory. Applying research on the complications of understanding and communicating risks, we then highlight how different visual representations are best suited to communicating different risk messages (i.e., their gist). In particular, we review verbal and visual messages that highlight gist representations that can better communicate health information and improve informed decision making. This discussion is informed by human factors theories and methods, which involve the study of how to maximize the interaction between humans and the tools they use. Finally, we present implications and recommendations for future research on human factors in health care.},

However, it can be difficult to manually synthesize a coherent narrative in a chart or graph due to the quantity of visualized attributes, a variety of salient features, and the awareness required to interpret points of interest (POIs). We present Temporal Summary Images (TSIs) as an approach for both exploring this data and creating stories from it. As a visualization, a TSI is composed of three common components: (1) a temporal layout, (2) comic strip-style data snapshots, and (3) textual annotations. To augment user analysis and exploration, we have developed a number of interactive techniques that recommend relevant data features and design choices, including an automatic annotations workflow. As the analysis and visual design processes converge, the resultant image becomes appropriate for data storytelling. For validation, we use a prototype implementation for TSIs to conduct two case studies with large-scale, scientific simulation datasets.},

abstract = {Images are inextricable from the daily practices of science, knowledge representation, and dissemination. Diagrams, maps, graphs, tables, drawings, illustrations, pho-tographs, simulations, computer visualizations, and body scans are used in everyday scientific work and publications. Furthermore, scientific images are increas-ingly traveling outside the laboratories and entering news magazines, courtrooms, and media. Today, we live in a visual culture (e.g., Stafford, 1996), which also values numbers (Porter, 1995; Rose, 1999) and science (Hubbard, 1988; Nelkin {\&} Tancredi, 1989). Scientific images rely on these cultural preferences to create persuasive representations. The ubiquity of scientific images has raised the interest of STS schol-ars in studying visual representations and in exploring the visual knowledges they engender. Visual representations in science have been studied from a variety of different the-oretical and disciplinary perspectives. Philosophers of science have raised ontological questions about the nature and properties of visual representations in science and have theorized about the intersection of hermeneutics and science (among others, Griesemer {\&} Wimsatt, 1989; Ruse {\&} Taylor, 1991; Griesemer, 1991, 1992; Ihde, 1999). Historians of science have pointed to the importance of scientific depictions of nature for the emergence of a new concept of objectivity in the nineteenth century (Daston {\&} Galison, 1992, 2007). They have drawn attention to visualization instruments and visual representations used in experimental systems from the Early Modern period to today (among many others see Cambrosio et al., 1993; Galison, 1997; Rheinberger, 1998; Kaiser, 2000; M{\'{e}}traux, 2000; Breidbach, 2002; Francoeur, 2002; Lef{\`{e}}vre et al., 2003; Hopwood, 2005; Lane, 2005). Other works have reconstructed the histories of (medical) visualization technologies and their introduction in the field of medicine (e.g., Yoxen, 1987; Pasveer, 1989, 1993; Blume, 1992; Lenoir {\&} L{\'{e}}cuyer, 1995; Holtzmann Kevles, 1997; Warwick, 2005; Joyce, 2006). Laboratory studies have exam-ined the use of images in the manufacture of scientific knowledge from sociological and anthropological perspectives (Latour {\&} Woolgar, Work on visual images at the intersection of STS and other disciplines is also thriv-ing. Scholars working in art studies proclaimed a "pictorial turn" in culture (Mitchell, 1994) and reflected on the relation of artistic and scientific images and on the regimes of representation in which they are displayed (e.g., Stafford, 1994, 1996; Jones {\&} Galison, 1998; Elkins, forthcoming). In Picturing Science, Producing Art, Caroline Jones and Peter Galison (1998) staged an encounter between art theorists' analyses of the modes of interpretation and STS's ideas about social construction of scientific knowl-edge and technologies of production. Style and genre as understood by art historians created contexts in which laboratory practices and cultural practices could be seen to share specific aesthetic forms. Finally, cultural studies explored the intersections of sci-entific imagery with popular narratives and culture (e.g., Holtzmann Kevles, 1997; Lammer, 2002; van Dijk, 2005; Locke, 2005) and reflected about images of the body from a feminist perspective (e.g., Duden, 1993; Cartwright, 1995; Casper, 1998; Treichler et al., 1998; Marchessault {\&} Sawchuk, 2000). Some of this work draws on semiotic, linguistic, psychoanalytical, and philosophical traditions of thinking about the visual and the existence of a visual language (e.g.. The body of work concerned with scientific visualizations is thus extremely diverse, and any attempt to synthesize the various strands would necessarily be reductive and selective. Because it is also a very lively area of concern, its boundaries are difficult to demarcate. Accordingly, instead of an exhaustive overview of the work done so far, this chapter outlines approaches to the social studies of scientific imaging and visu-alization (SIV) and raises some further questions and directions concerning the future study of visual representations in science.},

abstract = {While information visualization frameworks and heuristics have traditionally been reluctant to include acquired codes of meaning, designers are making use of them in a wide variety of ways. Acquired codes leverage a user's experience to understand the meaning of a visualization. They range from figurative visualizations which rely on the reader's recognition of shapes, to conventional arrangements of graphic elements which represent particular subjects. In this study, we used content analysis to codify acquired meaning in visualization. We applied the content analysis to a set of infographics and data visualizations which are exemplars of innovative and effective design. 88{\%} of the infographics and 71{\%} of data visualizations in the sample contain at least one use of figurative visualization. Conventions on the arrangement of graphics are also widespread in the sample. In particular, a comparison of representations of time and other quantitative data showed that conventions can be specific to a subject. These results suggest that there is a need for information visualization research to expand its scope beyond perceptual channels, to include social and culturally constructed meaning. Our paper demonstrates a viable method for identifying figurative techniques and graphic conventions and integrating them into heuristics for visualization design.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of the first experiment in the United States designed to distinguish between two sources of ambiguity: imprecise ambiguity (expert groups agree on a range of probability, but not on any point estimate) versus conflict ambiguity (each expert group provides a precise probability estimate which differs from one group to another). The specific context is whether risk professionals (here, insurers) behave differently under risk (when probability is well-specified) and different types of ambiguity in pricing catastrophic risks (floods and hurricanes) and non-catastrophic risks (house fires). The data show that insurers charge higher premiums when faced with ambiguity than when the probability of a loss is well specified (risk). Furthermore, they tend to charge more for conflict ambiguity than imprecise ambiguity for flood and hurricane hazards, but less in the case of fire. The source of ambiguity also impacts causal inferences insurers make to reduce their uncertainty.},

abstract = {It seemed to some of us that who you were, and where you were, determined to a very considerable extent what you were able to see as the facts.-Desmond Tutu, On the Soweto Uprising At the International Ethics Roundtable in 2014 on Information Ethics and Global Citizenship, Rafael Capurro spoke on citizenship in the digital age and called for a phenomenology of messages, not a hermeneutic phenomenology but a phenomenology of communication, to work on the level of the transmission of messages and decisions on their form that impact their interpretation. Scholars in communication studies (Langlois, 2011; Drucker 2011) and sociology of information (Knorr-Cetina, 2003) and others have been concerned with the meaning potential of codes, interfaces and other aspects of digitally mediated communication that produce the virtual containers forming messages, and thus also informing them. While some scholars focus on aspects of " transmissive control " (McKelvey, 2008) and how internet routing algorithms impact what can be seen and when by those communicating, others have focused on the level of the interfaces themselves asking what happens when the notion of " user " is substituted for that of a " subject " (Drucker, 2011, p.1). Capurro was concerned with what happens to democracy in the face of technicity (or the shift from modernism to what Manuel Castells famously called informationalism) and a situation where he sees the freedom of code superseding and perhaps impeding the freedom of information. In this context, the conversation about " information ethics " emerges; giving rise to questions about the role of education in the face of the increasingly urgent and complex needs for ethical information literacy education. While phenomenology of communication does exist under the rubric of communicology 1 – a postpositivist discipline that draws on phenomenology and 1 Lanigan, R. L. (1992). The human science of communicology: A phenomenology of discourse in Foucault and Merleau-Ponty. Pittsburgh, PA: Duquesne University Press. Cambre and Arshad-Ayaz 65 semiotics to study embodiment, consciousness and meaning-making as part of scholarly efforts to create space to fashion and position oneself otherwise – not enough scholarly attention has been given to this emergent area. Communicology has the potential to help scholars detect emerging aesthetics and cultural forms specific to an informatic society or what Lev Manovich (2005) has described as info-aesthetics. It goes without saying that the representation of information (form, design or containers of various sorts) is also information, and is not neutral. The scale and volume of information availability has driven the development of forms of data and information visualization. However, these areas, where many decisions are made with regarding to what exactly will be foregrounded and backgrounded, are populated by " designers, computer scientists, and artists " that, while helping us understand the data in certain ways, can also end up " simply anesthetizing it " (Manovich 2005, p.3). This last observation Manovich makes, alerts scholars to the need that Kimberli Kelmor (2014) justifies as a right to information meaning citizens are included in the oversight of how information is presented: But how are citizens prepared for these decisions? The field of education is slow to embrace changes that have already had transformative impact in other social sciences where the monolithic conception of modern scientific knowledge has been questioned in terms of its epistemological privilege in relation to other knowledges},

@article{Cameron2011,
abstract = {As the number of people in need of help increases, the degree of compassion people feel for them ironically tends to decrease. This phenomenon is termed the collapse of compassion. Some researchers have suggested that this effect happens because emotions are not triggered by aggregates. We provide evidence for an alternative account. People expect the needs of large groups to be potentially overwhelming, and, as a result, they engage in emotion regulation to prevent themselves from experiencing overwhelming levels of emotion. Because groups are more likely than individuals to elicit emotion regulation, people feel less for groups than for individuals. In Experiment 1, participants displayed the collapse of compassion only when they expected to be asked to donate money to the victims. This suggests that the effect is motivated by self-interest. Experiment 2 showed that the collapse of compassion emerged only for people who were skilled at emotion regulation. In Experiment 3, we manipulated emotion regulation. Participants who were told to down-regulate their emotions showed the collapse of compassion, but participants who were told to experience their emotions did not. We examined the time course of these effects using a dynamic rating to measure affective responses in real time. The time course data suggested that participants regulate emotion toward groups proactively, by preventing themselves from ever experiencing as much emotion toward groups as toward individuals. These findings provide initial evidence that motivated emotion regulation drives insensitivity to mass suffering.},

I contend that overall assessments are innately arbitrary, that benchmarks can be established for reasonable evaluations of forecast accuracy, that blanket assessments of forecasts are unwarranted, that there are strong (but necessarily limited) theoretical foundations for the models, and that models should be revised in the light of experience, while remaining careful to avoid data-mining.

In order to complete a convincing result, data of 5 regular NBA seasons was collected for model training and data of 1 NBA regular season was used as scoring dataset. After processes of automated data collection and cloud techniques enabled data management, a data mart containing NBA statistics data is built. Then machine learning models mentioned above is trained and tested by consuming data in the data mart. After applying scoring dataset to evaluate the model accuracy, Simple Logistics Classifier finally yields the best result with an accuracy of 69.67{\%}. The results obtained are compared to other methods from different source. It was found that results of this project are more persuasive since such a vast quantity of data was applied in this project.

This paper aims to investigate the influence of social media on employees' work performance and the underlying mechanism for how they create value at work. Based on media synchronicity and social capital theories, we propose that social media can promote work performance by stimulating trust among employees and offering a communication channel where explicit and implicit knowledge can be effectively transferred. The research model is tested using data collected from 105 Chinese software professionals. The results reveal that social media can enhance trust among employees. The direct effect on knowledge transfer was not significant but the impact was mediated by trust. Trust enhances knowledge exchange in the workplace with a stronger influence on the transfer of implicit knowledge rather than explicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge transfer was significantly related to work performance, while explicit knowledge transfer did not significantly influence work performance. The theoretical and practical contributions of this study are discussed.},

In addition, cognitive segmentation utilizes participants' own seman- tics for eliciting and aggregating cognitions. This method allows researchers to understand content in light of structure, as partici- pants' elicited cognitive contents are further interpreted as a func- tion of the complexity of their cognitive structures. The conceptual foundations from personal construct theory as well as a description of the nine-step implementation process whereby participants fill out a modified version of Kelly's Repertory Grid and complete Borman's trait implication procedure are provided. An application illustrates how cognitive segmentation can identify and assess the size potential of each customer target as a function of their cognitive content and structure.

abstract = {The team aspects of software engineering have been a subject of great interest since early work by Fred Brooks and others: how well do people work together in teams? why do people join teams? what happens if teams are distributed? Re- cently, the emergence of project ecosystems such as GitHub have created an entirely new, higher level of organization. GitHub supports numerous teams; they share a common technical platform (for work activities) and a common social platform (via following, commenting, etc ). We explore the GitHub evidence for socialization as a precursor to joining a project, and how the technical factors of past experience and social factors of past connections to team members of a project a ect productivity both initially and in the long run. We find that migration in GitHub is strongly a ected by pre-existing relationships; furthermore, we find that the presence of past social connections combined with prior ex- perience in languages dominant in the project leads to higher productivity both initially and cumulatively. Interestingly, we also find that stronger social connections are associated with slightly less productivity initially, but slightly more productivity in the long run.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to identify variables which may potentially influence player performance, and to implement a statistical model to study their relative contribution in order to explain two outcomes: points and win score. We used all the possible variables affecting player performance creating a comprehensive database from two sources of statistical information about the NBA 2007 regular season: www.basketballreference. com and www.nbastuffer.com. The data employed for the analysis were composed of 2187 cases (27 players*81 games), having followed a filtering process. We dealt with a balanced study design with repeated measurements given that each player was observed the same number of games, and therefore the player was considered as a random effect. We carried out mixed models to quantify the variability in points and win score among players. Minutes played, the usage percentage and the difference of quality between teams were the main factors for variations in points made and win score. The interaction between player position and age was important in win score. We encourage managers and coaches of sports teams to choose appropriate methods according to their aims. Future research should take into consideration the use of models with random effects on players' characteristics.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes.

abstract = {Visual analytics (VA) is typically applied in scenarios where complex data has to be analyzed. Unfortunately, there is a natural correlation between the complexity of the data and the complexity of the tools to study them. An adverse effect of complicated tools is that analytical goals are more difficult to reach. Therefore, it makes sense to consider methods that guide or assist users in the visual analysis process. Several such methods already exist in the literature, yet we are lacking a general model that facilitates in-depth reasoning about guidance. We establish such a model by extending van Wijk's model of visualization with the fundamental components of guidance. Guidance is defined as a process that gradually narrows the gap that hinders effective continuation of the data analysis. We describe diverse inputs based on which guidance can be generated and discuss different degrees of guidance and means to incorporate guidance into VA tools. We use existing guidance approaches from the literature to illustrate the various aspects of our model. As a conclusion, we identify research challenges and suggest directions for future studies. With our work we take a necessary step to pave the way to a systematic development of guidance techniques that effectively support users in the context of VA.},

abstract = {Basketball is a game of decisions; at any moment, a player can change the character of a possession by choosing to pass, dribble, or shoot. The current state of basketball analytics, however, provides no way to quantitatively evaluate the vast majority of decisions that players make, as most metrics are driven by events that occur at or near the end of a possession, such as points, turnovers, and assists. We propose a framework for using plater-tracking data to assign a point value to each moment of a possession by computing how many points the offense is expected to score by the end of the possession, a quantity we call expected possession value (EPV). EPV allows analysts to evaluate every decision made during a basketball game - whether it is to pass, dribble, or shoot - opening the door for a multitude of new metrics and analyses of basketball that quantify value in terms of points. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for estimating EPV, present results of EPV computations performed using player-tracking data from the 2012-2013 season, adn provide several examples of EPV-derived metrics that answer real basketball questions.},

The study considers several draft styles including point based drafting, value based drafting, risk-averse drafting and risk neutral drafting. It attempts to determine the risk level that provides risk neutral drafting, as well as the ways risk neutrality can increase a team owner's utility, where utility is directly related to the fantasy point output of a team. The paper finds that risk neutrality involves hedging auction bids by 10{\%} and using a position specific pricing and discount bonus of the same amount. Using value based bidding in a risk-neutral scenario was confirmed as the best overall auction draft strategy for increasing utility, but in a draft with multiple risk neutral bidders, bidding with risk aversion was a conditionally optimal strategy.},

Here we examine people's explanations for norm violations in different domains: harmful acts (e.g., assault) and impure acts (e.g., incest). Across four studies, we find evidence for an attribution asymmetry: people endorse more person-based attributions for impure versus harmful acts. This attribution asymmetry is partly explained by the abnormality of impure versus harmful acts, but not by differences in the moral wrongness or the statistical frequency of these acts. Finally, this asymmetry persists even when the situational factors that lead an agent to act impurely are stipulated. These results suggest that, relative to harmful acts, impure acts are linked to person-based attributions.},

In line with the exploratory sequential mixed methods research design, the first phase of the study utilised such qualitative procedures as; free-thought listing, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to explore the antecedents, dimensions and market consequences of the brand perceptions held by Zimbabwean consumers for professional football teams. In the second phase of this study, the finding from the qualitative phase were used to generate data collection instruments for questionnaire survey. Structured observation was also used to gather data in this phase. The SPSS version 21.0 and NVivo 10 data analysis packages were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The findings from the study were used to develop the Sports Team Brand Hierarchy Conceptual Framework, a conceptual model which ranks sports teams from different countries in a single hierarchy, according to financial structure and level of brand development. The framework can be used to determine the level of brand development and geographical sphere of influence of sports brands. It also provides guidelines on the growth strategies that teams, at the various levels of brand development can adopt for sustainable growth and competitive advantage.},

abstract = {Although basketball games have received broad attention, the forms of game reports and webcast are purely content-based cross-media: texts, videos, snapshots, and performance figures. Analytical narrations of games that seek to compose a complete game from heterogeneous datasets are challenging for general media producers because such a composition is time-consuming and heavily depends on domain experts. In particular, an appropriate analytical commentary of basketball games requires two factors, namely, rich context and domain knowledge, which includes game events, player locations, player profiles, and team profiles, among others. This type of analytical commentary elicits a timely and effective basketball game data visualization made up of different sources of media. Existing visualizations of basketball games mainly profile a particular aspect of the game. Therefore, this paper presents an expressive visualization scheme that comprehensively illustrates NBAgames with three levels of details: a season level, a game level, and a session level.We reorganize a basketball game as a sequence of sessions to depict the game states and heated confrontations. We design and implement a live system that integrates multimedia NBA datasets: play-by-play text data, box score data, game video data, and action area data.We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme with case studies and user feedbacks.},

abstract = {Geo-visualization brings whole new meanings and techniques for spatial analysis. Many visualizations techniques are developed and used for geo-domain. The taxonomy of visualization can help developers to grasp the key techniques of visualization. It also helps domain users to understand how some one visualization technique works and to choose the fit technique to use for analysis. Some researches on taxonomy adopt one or more factors, such as data type, display style, interactivity, etc. But all these frameworks treat the developers and the users as the same. But there are different concerns between algorithm developers and technique users. So this paper gives two classifications. The classification for visualization technique developers uses two factors, i.e. data type and analytic task. And the classification for user applies representation style and interactivity degree as factors. This framework shows our standpoint that visualization merges representation function and interaction function and its real role is analysis rather than display. Former classification or surveys on visualization often mix up techniques and systems. But they are in different level. We present taxonomy for systems to clarify this confusion. Based on this new taxonomy framework, this paper discusses the present status on research of geo-visualization techniques. It is shown that the research is stepping from visualization representation to visualization analysis, which is closer to the full meaning of visualization.},

Standard approaches in evaluating and predicting team performance are based on history-related factors such as past victories or defeats, record in qualification games and margin of victory in past games. In contrast with traditional models, in this paper we propose a model based on the observation of players' be- havior on the pitch. We model a the game of a team as a network and extract simple network measures, showing the value of our approach on predicting the outcomes of a long-running tournament such as Italian major league.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to propose a set of network methods to measure the specific properties of a team. These metrics were organised at macro-analysis levels. The interactions between teammates were collected and then processed following the analysis levels herein announced. Overall, 577 offensive plays were analysed from five matches. The network density showed an ambiguous relationship among the team, mainly during the 2nd half. The mean values of density for all matches were 0.48 in the 1st half, 0.32 in the 2nd half and 0.34 for the whole match. The heterogeneity coefficient for the overall matches rounded to 0.47 and it was also observed that this increased in all matches in the 2nd half. The centralisation values showed that there was no 'star topology'. The results suggest that each node (i.e., each player) had nearly the same connectivity, mainly in the 1st half. Nevertheless, the values increased in the 2nd half, showing a decreasing participation of all players at the same level. Briefly, these metrics showed that it is possible to identify how players connect with each other and the kind and strength of the connections between them. In summary, it may be concluded that network metrics can be a powerful tool to help coaches understand team's specific properties and support decision-making to improve the sports training process based on match analysis.},

Despite this, the nature of belief, which underpins the construct of delusions, has received little formal investigation. No account of delusions, however, would be complete without a cognitive level analysis of belief per se. One reason for this neglect is the assumption that, unlike more established and accessible modular psychological process (e.g., vision, audition, face-recognition, language-processing, and motor-control systems), beliefs comprise more distributed and therefore less accessible central cognitive processes. In this paper, we suggest some defining characteristics and functions of beliefs. Working back from cognitive accounts of delusions, we consider potential candidate cognitive processes that may be involved in normal belief formation. Finally, we advance a multistage account of the belief process that could provide the basis for a more comprehensive model of belief.},

abstract = {Dual-process theories of moral judgment suggest that responses to moral dilemmas are guided by two moral principles: the principle of deontology states that the morality of an action depends on the intrinsic nature of the action (e.g., harming others is wrong regardless of its consequences); the principle of utilitarianism implies that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences (e.g., harming others is acceptable if it increases the well-being of a greater number of people). Despite the proposed independence of the moral inclinations reflecting these principles, previous work has relied on operationalizations in which stronger inclinations of one kind imply weaker inclinations of the other kind. The current research applied Jacoby's (1991) process dissociation procedure to independently quantify the strength of deontological and utilitarian inclinations within individuals. Study 1 confirmed the usefulness of process dissociation for capturing individual differences in deontological and utilitarian inclinations, revealing positive correlations of both inclinations to moral identity. Moreover, deontological inclinations were uniquely related to empathic concern, perspective-taking, and religiosity, whereas utilitarian inclinations were uniquely related to need for cognition. Study 2 demonstrated that cognitive load selectively reduced utilitarian inclinations, with deontological inclinations being unaffected. In Study 3, a manipulation designed to enhance empathy increased deontological inclinations, with utilitarian inclinations being unaffected. These findings provide evidence for the independent contributions of deontological and utilitarian inclinations to moral judgments, resolving many theoretical ambiguities implied by previous research.},

The literature suggests factors such as extraversion, emotional stability and openness to experience are related to uses of social applications on the Internet. Using a national sample of US adults, this study investigated the relationship between these three dimensions of the Big-Five model and social media use (defined as use of social networking sites and instant messages). It also examined whether gender and age played a role in that dynamic. Results revealed that while extraversion and openness to experiences were positively related to social media use, emotional stability was a negative predictor, controlling for socio-demographics and life satisfaction. These findings differed by gender and age. While extraverted men and women were both likely to be more frequent users of social media tools, only the men with greater degrees of emotional instability were more regular users. The relationship between extraversion and social media use was particularly important among the young adult cohort. Conversely, being open to new experiences emerged as an important personality predictor of social media use for the more mature segment of the sample. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to analyse the effects of using inside pass on ball possession effectiveness and to identify game performance indicators to predict inside pass success in the National Basketball Association (NBA), considering situational variables. A total of 4207 closed ball possessions (± 10 points difference) where recorded from 25 matches of the 2010 NBA Playoffs series. Ball possessions were classified whether including inside pass (n=808) or not (n=3399). Predictive analysis of use and effectiveness was made through a series of binomial logistic regressions and Classification tree analysis (CHAID). Results indicate that ball possessions including inside pass were more effective and longer in duration, finding a greater use in top-4 NBA teams regardless the game period. Additionally, inside pass effectiveness was influenced by: the receiver attitude, reception distance, and defensive help. Particularly, the analysis of combined performance indicators disclosed relevant information on attack effectiveness, suggesting players to adopt a dynamic attitude in the weak side before getting the ball, while their teammates are developing individual and collective actions to create free space and enhance inside game options and effectiveness. Current findings shed some light on specific knowledge concerning tactical behaviours in NBA basketball, contributing in the design of specific programmes to increase inside game options and players' decision- making according to specific game constraints.},

@article{Cowan2001,
abstract = {Miller (1956) summarized evidence that people can remember about seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.},

abstract = {This article demonstrates theoretically that, given a casual relationship exists from league parity to fan interest, as large-market teams myopically outbid small-market teams for talent there is potential for league parity to be underprovided. In this model, league parity is treated as a public good. With this characterization, this article arrives at the familiar economic result that public goods tend to be underprovided. This article does not discuss the impact of declining league parity intertemporally. Intuition suggests this decline could hamper interest in the league sport and even lead to a smaller fan base. The results suggest that if league parity is an important determinant of fan interest, a league lump-sum payment (transfer) and tax (subsidy) system may result in higher league profits. The article does add as a caveat that the authors are in no way justifying the revenue sharing plan adopted by Major League Baseball or any other league.},

abstract = {A number of methods have been proposed for predicting game winners in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) annual men's college basketball championship tournament. Since 1985, more than 70{\%} of the teams in the fourth, fifth, and sixth rounds of the tournament have been high-seeded teams (i.e., teams assigned seeds of one, two, or three); a method that can accurately compare two such teams is often necessary to predict games in these rounds. This paper statistically analyzes tournaments from 1985 to 2009. A key finding is that there is an insignificant difference between the historical win percentages of high-seeded teams in each of the fourth, fifth, and sixth tournament rounds, which implies that choosing the higher seed to win games between these seeds does not provide accurate predictions in these rounds, and alternate predictors or methods should be sought. Implications on gambling point spreads are discussed},

Various aspects are explored in this paper, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles.

The ability for data consumers to adopt a follow your nose approach, traversing links defined within a dataset or across independently-curated datasets, is an essential feature of this new Web of Data, enabling richer knowledge retrieval thanks to synthesis across multiple sources of, and views on, inter-related datasets. But for the Web of Data to be successful, we must design novel ways of interacting with the corresponding very large amounts of complex, interlinked, multi-dimensional data throughout its management cycle. The design of user interfaces for Linked Data, and more specifically interfaces that represent the data visually, play a central role in this respect. Contributions to this special issue on Linked Data visualisation investigate different approaches to harnessing visualisation as a tool for exploratory discovery and basic-to-advanced analysis. The papers in this volume illustrate the design and construction of intuitive means for end-users to obtain new insight and gather more knowledge, as they follow links defined across datasets over the Web of Data.},

I argue that the composition of a person's core personality makes some people more responsive to mobilization cues than others. However, the degree to which personality alters the effectiveness of mobilization also depends on the type of political participation for which people are being mobilized. I explore the determinants of political participation by looking at the interaction between the Big-5 traits of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability and the intensity of campaign environments. This paper demonstrates that despite the possible ameliorative effect mobilization has on unequal patterns of political participation, an enduring source of participatory inequality may very well be rooted in a person's core psychological structure.},

In this study we describe the performance of a group of mild AD patients and a group of normal controls on the recall of three different types of stories: a previously unknown story, a well-known fairy-tale (Cinderella), and a modified well-known fairy-tale (Little Red Riding Hood is not eaten by the wolf). The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that in patients who tend to produce intrusions, over-learned information interferes with episodic recall, i.e., the retrieval of specific, unique past episodes. AD patients produced significantly more intrusions in the recall of the modified fairy-tale compared to the recall of the two other stories. Intrusions in the recall of the modified fairy-tale always consisted of elements of the original version of the story. We suggest that in AD patients intrusions may be traced back to the interference of strongly represented, over-learned information in episodic memory recall. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

These do not behave uniformly, but present more predictable areas. In turn, we have analyzed the scoring in the games regarding the differences in points. Exists different areas of behavior related with the scorea and each zone has a different nature. There are point that we can consider as tipping points. The presence of these critical points suggests that there are phase transitions where the dynamic scoring of the games varies significantly.},

The paper investigates the levels, the methods and models with which the topic has been studied, and discusses potential (dis)advantages of each of those. We focus on early school leaving in all its complexity, and on the interplay of relevant (levels of) factors, rather than on just certain factors, typically located in individual students, schools or families. The findings in the literature are discussed and placed into perspective. Finally, a wide set of policy measures are discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper examines competitive balance in the most prominent basketball league in the world: the NBA. Two types of graphs are used. First, long-term competitive balance is studied based on actual positions achieved by the teams on the Regu-lar Season. On the other hand, the competitive balance levels for each season are analyzed using sport betting odds data and through the use of two alternative strategies. In the first approach, density functions for the number of victories for all teams within a season are known, whereas in the second approach, a kernel density function of team winning probability is deter-mined for each season. Thus, a prospective competitive balance analysis is conducted. The study period covers seasons 1993-94 and 2011-12. The results suggest that long-term competitive balance levels are high, as many teams change their classifications. At season level, competitive balance seems to improve along the period studied. However, there are still too many differences between the teams in the same season. Keywords:},

As a medium for consumer activity and interaction, scholars and industry professionals can leverage social media to monitor the effects of sponsorship in real time, as consumers experience a sporting event. In this exploratory study, we employed a mixed methods study design to examine Twitter users' discussion of 2013 French Open sponsors during the tennis tournament. We found a weak positive relationship between sponsor-event functional fit and positive sponsor-related sentiment, and a weak positive relationship between a sponsor company's social media presence and event-related buzz. Through case study analysis, we discovered unintended misrepresentation and activation were apparent drivers of sponsor-related social media conversation during the 2013 French Open.

abstract = {While the literature on sponsorship of sport has gained interest among scholars in diverse fields such as management, marketing, and psychology in recent years, scant attention has been paid to the extent in which sponsoring may serve as a strategic lever that is mutually beneficial for sponsors and sponsees. We, therefore, ask: What constitutes strategic sponsoring in professional sport? In addressing our research question, we selectively review the literature on sport sponsoring, link it to the basic tenets of the resource-based view, and conceptualize this literature into a framework for strategic sponsoring in professional sport. In developing our framework, we consider the concept of regime as the key defining working principle of strategic sponsorship activities. We then elicit six different regimes: the cause regime, loyalty regime, appropriability regime, value-differential regime, heuristics-based regime, and associational regime. Each one of these regime types is further related to the six sponsorship activities identified in our literature review. In proposing how various regimes serve as generative mechanisms for altering the resource and knowledge-bases of sponsors and sponsees, we provide a conceptually rigorous framework of strategic sponsoring that expands the limits of extant views of sport sponsorship. Hence, our multilevel framework advances sponsorship theory through a more rigorous framing, and it provides practitioners clues for rethinking their sponsorship programs.},

Although spending on sponsorship is expected to increase more in the future and sport dominates the pie of sponsorship revenue, the relationship between sponsorship and purchase intentions of consumers is still vague and needs elaborate research. Current study is an attempt to contribute understanding of sponsorship in sport context and aims to evaluate sport sponsorship effectiveness by investigating antecedents of attitudes towards sponsor and purchase intentions. A conceptual model was developed to examine the effects of factors such as perceived sincerity, perceived fit between the sponsor and sport team and team attachment on attitude towards sponsor and intentions to purchase sponsor's products. The measurement model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis and hypothesized model was tested by using Structural equation modeling (SEM). The data were collected from spectators of a Turkish basketball game in the arena before the start of game. The results suggest that perceived fit and team attachment have positive influence on sincerity perceptions which in turn create positive attitudes toward sponsor and greater purchase intentions for products of sponsor. Findings of the study have important implications for sponsors and future research.},

abstract = {Traditional NBA player evaluation metrics are based on scoring differential or some pace-adjusted linear combination of box score statistics like points, rebounds, assists, etc. These measures treat performances with the outcome of the game still in question (e.g. tie score with five minutes left) in exactly the same way as they treat performances with the outcome virtually decided (e.g. when one team leads by 30 points with one minute left). Because they ignore the context in which players perform, these measures can result in misleading estimates of how players help their teams win. We instead use a win probability framework for evaluating the impact NBA players have on their teams' chances of winning. We propose a Bayesian linear regression model to estimate an individual player's impact, after controlling for the other players on the court. We introduce several posterior summaries to derive rank-orderings of players within their team and across the league. This allows us to identify highly paid players with low impact relative to their teammates, as well as players whose high impact is not captured by existing metrics.},

abstract = {We give an algorithm for properly learning Poisson binomial distributions. A Poisson bino-mial distribution (PBD) of order n ∈ Z + is the discrete probability distribution of the sum of n mutually independent Bernoulli random variables. Given O(1/ǫ 2) samples from an unknown PBD P, our algorithm runs in time (1/ǫ) O(log log(1/ǫ)) , and outputs a hypothesis PBD that is ǫ-close to P in total variation distance. The sample complexity of our algorithm is known to be nearly-optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as established in previous work [DDS12]. How-ever, the previously best known running time for properly learning PBDs [DDS12, DKS15b] was (1/ǫ) O(log(1/ǫ)) , and was essentially obtained by enumeration over an appropriate ǫ-cover. We remark that the running time of this cover-based approach cannot be improved, as any ǫ-cover for the space of PBDs has size (1/ǫ) Ω(log(1/ǫ)) [DKS15b]. As one of our main contributions, we provide a novel structural characterization of PBDs, showing that any PBD P is ǫ-close to another PBD Q with O(log(1/ǫ)) distinct parame-ters. More precisely, we prove that, for all ǫ {\textgreater} 0, there exists an explicit collection M of (1/ǫ) O(log log(1/ǫ)) vectors of multiplicities, such that for any PBD P there exists a PBD Q with O(log(1/ǫ)) distinct parameters whose multiplicities are given by some element of M, such that Q is ǫ-close to P. Our proof combines tools from Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry. Our approach to the proper learning problem is as follows: Starting with an accurate non-proper hypothesis, we fit a PBD to this hypothesis. More specifically, we essentially start with the hypothesis computed by the computationally efficient non-proper learning algorithm in our recent work [DKS15b]. Our aforementioned structural characterization allows us to reduce the corresponding fitting problem to a collection of (1/ǫ) O(log log(1/ǫ)) systems of low-degree polynomial inequalities. We show that each such system can be solved in time (1/ǫ) O(log log(1/ǫ)) , which yields the overall running time of our algorithm.},

The intention is not to recognize tribal relationships between fans and their club but to identify to what extent the fan commitment level can impact the preference for sponsor brands. Findings – Research questions posed in this study were mostly confirmed: football-devoted supporters have a kind of cult with their club and it is possible to distinguish several distinct fan typologies varying with the level of fan commitment. The associative behaviour of football fans is influenced by affiliation through the need for social recognition, socialization and symbolism. The study also reveals that devoted fans assume an effective knowledge of club association with some brands but they do not manifest an effective preference towards them Managerial implications are related to the club needing to maintain an open channel with supporters. Sponsor brands should also develop a long-term strategy and support another sport besides football.

abstract = {Similar to oil that acted as a basic raw material and key driving force of industrial society, information acts as a raw material and principal mover of knowledge society in the knowledge production, propagation and application. New developments in information processing and information communication technologies allow increasingly complex and accurate descriptions, representations and models, which are often multi-parameter, multi-perspective, multi-level and multidimensional. This leads to the necessity of collaborative work between different domains with corresponding specialist competences, sciences and research traditions. We present several major transdisciplinary unification projects for information and knowledge, which proceed on the descriptive, logical and the level of generative mechanisms. Parallel process of boundary crossing and transdisciplinary activity is going on in the applied domains. Technological artifacts are becoming increasingly complex and their design is strongly user-centered, which brings in not only the function and various technological qualities but also other aspects including esthetic, user experience, ethics and sustainability with social and environmental dimensions. When integrating knowledge from a variety of fields, with contributions from different groups of stakeholders, numerous challenges are met in establishing common view and common course of action. In this context, information is our environment, and informational ecology determines both epistemology and spaces for action. We present some insights into the current state of the art of transdisciplinary theory and practice of information studies and informatics. We depict different facets of transdisciplinarity as we see it from our different research fields that include information studies, computability, human-computer interaction, multi-operating-systems environments and philosophy.},

abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In 'The Future of Data Analysis', he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or 'data analysis'. Ten to twenty years ago, John Chambers, Bill Cleveland and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland even suggested the catchy name "Data Science" for his envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon is the emergence of "Data Science" programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most recently the Univ. of Michigan, which on September 8, 2015 announced a {\$}100M "Data Science Initiative" that will hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; in general, though, the new initiatives steer away from close involvement with academic statistics departments. This paper reviews some ingredients of the current "Data Science moment", including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether Data Science is really different from Statistics. The now-contemplated field of Data Science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning which adds some technology for 'scaling up' to 'big data'. This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in Data Science is not about mere 'scaling up', but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are 'learning from data', and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's Data Science Initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.},

abstract = {Marketers are charged with the responsibility of attracting consumers and encouraging loyalty for their brands. Double jeopardy, a marketing law observed across numerous product and service settings, contends that loyalty is largely influenced by a brand's market share. There have been suggestions that sport may be one of the few areas immune to such effects, providing researchers with an opportunity to test how sport brand loyalty may be impacted by market share. The current research capitalises on this opportunity by assessing the effects of market share on attitudinal loyalty reported by a sample of 794 Australian sport fans. ANOVA tests revealed that fans of high market share brands displayed higher levels of attitudinal loyalty towards their favourite teams in comparison to small market share team fans. Further tests revealed that differences existed in terms of the brand association perceptions held by high and small market share team fans, and how these contributed to predicting attitudinal loyalty. Consequently, sport marketers should be cognisant of double jeopardy effects when evaluating sport brands and formulating marketing strategies, though future research is needed to determine the full applicability of double jeopardy within the sport context. ?? 2012 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

abstract = {The results from this study extend previous research by empirically testing the involvement based Psychological Continuum Model (PCM) segmentation procedure on sports spectators. To date, the procedure has only been verified using sports participants, although the PCM was developed with a broader range of sports consumers in mind. The validity of the procedure is confirmed using two online surveys, which gather data from spectators at both the league (n=761) and team (n=623) level. A three-step segmentation procedure then places respondents into the PCM stages – awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance. ANOVA tests indicate that the four groups significantly differ from one another on attitudinal and behavioural measures for both league and team spectators. Findings suggest that the PCM is an appropriate framework to investigate fan development at both league and team levels. Thus sports marketers are provided with a research segmentation tool capable of helping them to better understand their heterogeneous consumer bases and thus guide marketing decisions.},

They have desirable aesthetic properties, but are difficult to create using conventional modeling tools. We present a method for creating zoomorphic shapes by merging a man-made shape and an animal shape. To identify a pair of shapes that are suitable for merging, we use an efficient graph kernel based technique. We formulate the merging process as a continuous optimization problem where the two shapes are deformed jointly to minimize an energy function combining several design factors. The modeler can adjust the weighting between these factors to attain high-level control over the final shape produced. A novel technique ensures that the zoomorphic shape does not violate the design restrictions of the man-made shape. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach by generating a wide variety of zoomorphic shapes.},

The model determines which games feature match-ups that are statistically most similar to the match-ups in historical upsets. The technique is then applied to the tournament in each of the 13 years from 2003 to 2015 in order to select two games as potential upsets each year. Of the 26 selected games, 10 (38.4{\%}) were actual upsets, which is more than twice as many as the expected number of correct selections when using a weighted random selection method.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Among these means of sport fan consumption is fantasy sport participation. While the activity has grown immensely within the past few decades, relatively little is known about who participates and what impact participation has on the consumption of sport products and services. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the differing modes of sport consumption exhibited by fantasy sport participants. Employing an orthogonal research design, the study uncovered four distinct consumption modes, each with differing patterns of behavior. Discussed are the theoretical results with regard to player attachment and psychological commitment to team as well as practical implications for sport marketers looking to utilize fantasy sport participation as an enhanced marketing communication tool.},

Yet to this point, little has been done to empirically explore this unique phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to create and validate an emotional attachment to a sport team scale. Guided by attachment theory and following a well-established scale development framework, a two-factor, seven-item scale was found to be a valid and reliable instrument. The two distinct factors termed Investment (cognitive feelings put into the team) and Dividend (affective feelings derived from the team) represent a unique contribution to the field of sport management. In addition, a construct validity test provided quantitative verification of an apparent hierarchy of the emotional attachment dimensions where those with higher Investment scores appear to place a higher (somewhat irrational) value on team success compared to those with higher Dividend scores.},

I argue that such atmospheres are co-productions by fans, who play their part in encouraging their team by suspending emotional and social restraint. I also investigate how with the intensified commercialisation of football, there have been recent concerns about a lack of atmosphere. All-seater stadia, sponsorship and corporate provision and the influx of new middle class fans seems to contrast with the packed terraces of fervent working class spectators of yesteryear, where closely packed bodies and loud collective chanting and singing produced a heady atmosphere. Accordingly, I will explore how clubs and fans have devised a range of strategies to manage atmospheres to inculcate greater intensities on match days. ?? 2013.},

Experiment 1 yielded supporting evidence for both of these propositions. Experiment 2 replicated the 1st experiment and ruled out a self-perception-based alternative explanation for the dissonance-reduction findings in Experiment 1.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We examine the problem of estimating a parametric binary choice model under a large family of loss functions (“scoring rules”). This problem is of economic interest since the scoring rules can be viewed as weighted averages over the utilities that heterogeneous decision makers derive from a pub- licly announced forecast (Shuford, Albert, and Massengill, 1966; Schervish, 1989). Our contribution is threefold. First, we review the scattered theoretical literature on the subject, and provide conditions that ensure the consistency of estimators implied by a variety of scoring rules. Second, we illustrate analytically and via simulations that the scoring rules yield (asymptotically) identical results, if the model is correctly specified. Under misspecification, the scoring rules may lead to different parameter estimates and forecasts, and the forecaster faces a choice over which decision makers to give a higher weight. Third, we present an out-of-sample analysis of directional inflation changes in the G7 coun- tries. This analysis highlights the empirical relevance of aligning the scoring rules used for parameter estimation and forecast evaluation. We also find that nonparametric alternatives which try to avoid misspecification tend to perform poorly out-of-sample},

abstract = {In this study, possible differences for roles of designers in different industry systems were explored. It was studied if expectancies from designers change according to industries they work. This study is linked with a prior study which has investigated general expectancies from designers to get a hint about their work environment. In a prior study done by the authors, it was investigated if concepts such as design thinking had any effect on requirements from designers. Since design thinking advocates designers to take active roles in managerial issues, and also require them to work with consumers as a team, it was hypothesized that recent job announcements may require capabilities related with these concepts. Also, when recent studies are evaluated, it can be seen that designers may take several different roles in companies. Therefore, it was investigated if capabilities referred in job announcements hinted any of the designer roles. It was found that companies asked for skills that addressed capabilities for designer roles such as team manager and process managers. However, the effects of industries' differing environments on requirements were not explored. In the scope of this study, it was aimed to interview representatives from different industries to understand how different business systems affect design, and how designers transform themselves for different roles. Therefore, how business dimension along with type of products and services a company provides affect and change roles and requirements from designers was studied. A total of 50 companies were studied; 10 companies from 5 different industries with diverse characters were briefly interviewed to understand industry effect on requirements from designers. Interviews were thematically coded to define capabilities each company required. Industries included were shoes {\&} bags, furniture accessories, jewellery, packaging and advertising {\&} exhibition. It was found that requirements from designers differed according to the industry a company operates. Companies},

@article{Esposito2017,
abstract = {The debate on the right to be forgotten on Google involves the relationship between human information processing and digital processing by algorithms. The specificity of digital memory is not so much its often discussed inability to forget. What distinguishes digital memory is, instead, its ability to process information without understanding. Algorithms only work with data (i.e. with differences) without remembering or forgetting. Merely calculating, algorithms manage to produce significant results not because they operate in an intelligent way, but because they ''parasitically'' exploit the intelligence, the memory, and the attribution of meaning by human actors. The specificity of algorithmic processing makes it possible to bypass the paradox of remembering to forget, which up to now blocked any human-based forgetting technique. If you decide to forget some memory, the most immediate effect is drawing attention to it, thereby activating remembering. Working differently from human intelligence, however, algorithms can implement, for the first time, the classical insight that it might be possible to reinforce forgetting not by erasing memories but by multiplying them. After discussing several projects on the web which implicitly adopt this approach, the article concludes by raising some deeper problems posed when algorithms use data and metadata to produce information that cannot be attributed to any human being.},

abstract = {We asked how team dynamics can be captured in relation to function by considering games in the first round of the NBA 2010 play-offs as networks. Defining players as nodes and ball movements as links, we analyzed the network properties of degree centrality, clustering, entropy and flow centrality across teams and positions, to characterize the game from a network perspective and to determine whether we can assess differences in team offensive strategy by their network properties. The compiled network structure across teams reflected a fundamental attribute of basketball strategy. They primarily showed a centralized ball distribution pattern with the point guard in a leadership role. However, individual play-off teams showed variation in their relative involvement of other players/positions in ball distribution, reflected quantitatively by differences in clustering and degree centrality. We also characterized two potential alternate offensive strategies by associated variation in network structure: (1) whether teams consistently moved the ball towards their shooting specialists, measured as "uphill/downhill" flux, and (2) whether they distributed the ball in a way that reduced predictability, measured as team entropy. These network metrics quantified different aspects of team strategy, with no single metric wholly predictive of success. However, in the context of the 2010 play-offs, the values of clustering (connectedness across players) and network entropy (unpredictability of ball movement) had the most consistent association with team advancement. Our analyses demonstrate the utility of network approaches in quantifying team strategy and show that testable hypotheses can be evaluated using this approach. These analyses also highlight the richness of basketball networks as a dataset for exploring the relationships between network structure and dynamics with team organization and effectiveness.},

abstract = {We examined in two empirical studies how situational and personal aspects of uncertainty influence laypeople's understanding of the uncertainty of scientific information, with focus on the detection of tentativeness and perception of scientific credibility. In the first study (N = 48), we investigated the impact of a perceived conflict due to contradicting information as a situational, text-inherent aspect of uncertainty. The aim of the second study (N = 61) was to explore the role of general self-efficacy as an intra-personal uncertainty factor. In Study 1, participants read one of two versions of an introductory text in a between-group design. This text provided them with an overview about the neurosurgical procedure of deep brain stimulation (DBS). The text expressed a positive attitude toward DBS in one experimental condition or focused on the negative aspects of this method in the other condition. Then participants in both conditions read the same text that dealt with a study about DBS as experimental treatment in a small sample of patients with major depression. Perceived conflict between the two texts was found to increase the perception of tentativeness and to decrease the perception of scientific credibility, implicating that text-inherent aspects have significant effects on critical appraisal. The results of Study 2 demonstrated that participants with higher general self-efficacy detected the tentativeness to a lesser degree and assumed a higher level of scientific credibility, indicating a more na{\"{i}}ve understanding of scientific information. This appears to be contradictory to large parts of previous findings that showed positive effects of high self-efficacy on learning. Both studies showed that perceived tentativeness and perceived scientific credibility of medical information contradicted each other. We conclude that there is a need for supporting laypeople in understanding the uncertainty of scientific information and that scientific writers should consider how to present scientific results when compiling pertinent texts.},

abstract = {Rottenberg's “The Baseball Players' Labor Market” holds the original ideas behind many threads of the sports economics literature. Most well known, the article contains both the invariance proposition (IP) and the uncertainty-of-outcome hypothesis. But there is also a rather complete specification of attendance demand and much more. Given this, it is strange that the IP has been “morphed” into the Coase theorem in portions of the sports economics literature. Rottenberg deserves better than footnote status, and an insightful empirical test is lost in this transformation. This article documents this and tests the IP directly on an occurrence missed so far in the literature (but also documented by Rottenberg) to point out the continued importance of the IP, even up to the golden anniversary of its original publication.},

Whether a planner that maximizes the sum of fan and owner surpluses prefers more balance or less in such a league depends on the relative magnitude of marginal consumers' surpluses with respect to talent in larger and smaller revenue markets. This relationship is much more complex than previous cases in the literature.

To better ensure financial viability into the twenty-first century, we argue that major professional teams should create a strategy to build a fan nation containing both local and distant loyal fans. We argue that teams should invent traditions to entice both local and far-flung casual, and non- fans to become loyal members of a team's fan nation. The recent actions of the National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers are used as a case study of how a team can use the invention of tradition to expand and enhance its fan base. Introduction},

Conversely, presumptively natural kinds provide the basis for new measurement and scoring systems.

While careful studies of earlier systems and methods have often un- covered these arbitrary aspects, newer technical tools for classification are at once substantially more opaque than their predecessors and more likely to be employed on very large scales. The classification situations to which they give rise thus have the potential to produce the sort of naturalized facticity charac- teristic of classical social facts. Keywords:},

First, limits on the identification of objects may reflect competition within networks that represent object identity (the ventral visual stream). Second, limits on the selection of multiple locations may reflect competition between selected locations within representations of visual space (the dorsal visual stream). This definition of visual resources provides a parsimonious explanation for many effects in the visual cognition literature, and it makes concrete predictions about manipulations that should affect performance across a wide variety of visual tasks.},

abstract = {In sports, there is a constant effort to improve metrics which assess player ability, but there has been almost no effort to quantify and compare existing metrics. Any individual making a management, coaching, or gambling decision is quickly overwhelmed with hundreds of statistics. We address this problem by proposing a set of "meta-metrics" which can be used to identify the metrics that provide the most unique, reliable, and useful information for decision-makers. Specifically, we develop methods to evalute metrics based on three criteria: 1) stability: does the metric measure the same thing over time 2) discrimination: does the metric differentiate between players and 3) independence: does the metric provide new information? Our methods are easy to implement and widely applicable so they should be of interest to the broader sports community. We demonstrate our methods in analyses of both NBA and NHL metrics. Our results indicate the most reliable metrics and highlight how they should be used by sports analysts. The meta-metrics also provide useful insights about how to best construct new metrics which provide independent and reliable information about athletes.},

abstract = {Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on both offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on defensive ones. Steals, blocks, and defensive rebounds provide only a limited summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet. This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal processes, matrix factorization techniques, and hierarchical regression models with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes, and quantifies multiple aspects of defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of defensive effectiveness, challenging others, and opening up many new insights into the defensive elements of basketball.},

abstract = {Many markets have “unraveled” and experienced inefficient, early, dispersed transactions, and subsequently developed institutions to delay transaction timing. It has previously proved difficult, however, to measure and identify the resulting efficiency gains. Prior to 1992, college football teams were matched for post-season play up to several weeks before the end of the regular season. Since 1992, the market has reorganized to postpone this matching. We show that the matching of teams affects efficiency as measured by the resulting television viewership, and that the reorganization promoted more efficient matching, chiefly as a result of the increased ability of later matching to produce “championship” games.

This systematic review extends the literature by (a) describing both policy and practice interven- tions, (b) synthesizing findings from experimental or quasi-experimental research, and (c) examining the common elements of effective interventions. Specifically, this review addresses two main questions. First, what are the characteristics of the empirical literature examining high school dropout or school completion interventions? Second, what are the common elements of effective policy or practice interventions for reducing high school dropout rates or increasing school completion rates? Findings indicate that despite research highlighting the need to address multiple risk factors and the need for early intervention, the bulk of current empirical research is focused on single-component, individual, or small group interventions delivered at the high school level. Further research is needed to provide guidance to schools regarding the integration of dropout efforts with other school initiatives. Multitiered frameworks of support are suggested as a structure for accom- plishing this effectively and efficiently.},

However, beyond this level of agreement there is much room for discussion about how to extend the variety of usability evaluation approaches for assessing information visualization techniques, and how to determine which ones are the most effective, and in what ways and for what purposes. In this chapter we take a user centered, Human-Computer Interaction-based perspective to discuss usability evaluation of information visualization techniques. We begin by presenting a singular view of the evolution of visualization techniques evaluation, briefly summarizing the main contributions of several works in this area since its humble beginning as a collateral activity until the recent growth of interest. Then, we focus on current issues related to such evaluations, particularly concerning the way they are designed and conducted, taking into account a background of well-known usability evaluation methods from HCI to help understanding why there are still open problems. A set of guidelines for a (more) user-centered usability evaluation of information visualization techniques is proposed and discussed. Our ultimate goal is to provide some insight regarding if and how sound ergonomic user-centered knowledge can be transferred to the information visualization context.},

This conceptual paper attempts to address this deficiency via the development of a new framework that is based upon two key dimensions: type of product and level of sports integration. By categorizing goods and services as either sports products or nonsports products and by differentiating between traditional strategies and sponsorship-based strategies, four sports marketing domains are identified. They are the theme-based, product-based, alignment-based, and sports-based strategic domains. The underlying principles for developing the framework are delineated in this article, and many examples for each strategic domain are provided as a means of illustrating their conceptual differences and how they are implemented.

abstract = {The vast majority of research on sport consumers fails to utilize a theoretical understanding of motivation to examine behaviour. Self-Determination Theory was used to develop a new understanding of sport consumer motivation. Sport consumer motivation is conceptualized as representing autonomy and control orientations that energize a desire to engage in sport goal directed behaviour to acquire positive benefits. A multi-attribute survey instrument was designed to measure five motivational sub-types and administered to three samples of sport consumers, with the goal of testing for reliability and validity (. N=. 1222). Structural equation modelling analysis revealed that control orientation of sport motivation regulates desired benefits of socialization and diversion. In contrast, autonomy orientation of motivation regulates desired benefits of performance, esteem and excitement. Sport consumer motivation explained over 60{\%} of the variance in game attendance, media usage, wearing team related clothing and purchasing team related merchandise. Results illustrate how sport consumer motivation represents intrinsically motivated behaviour that treats sport consumption activity as an end in itself as well as extrinsically motivated behaviour as the engagement in an activity is to obtain a separable instrumental outcome from the activity itself. {\textcopyright} 2011 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

abstract = {Attitude-related research in the existing sport literature has focused on measurement of the affect component to examine existing attitudes towards sport teams. Recent studies question sole reliance upon affective reactions to assess sport consumers' attitudes towards sport teams. Current thinking conceptualises attitudes as possessing distinct structural properties such as importance, extremity, accessibility, certainty, and so on, whose combined presence is believed to be a better measure of attitude formation towards a focal object. This paper presents a conceptual model to advance our understanding of attitude formation relative to sport and athletic teams. The Fan Attitude Network (FAN) Model proposes a process through which the fulfilment of dispositional needs serves as a catalyst for the internalisation of a sport team. The internalisation process culminates in a sport identity that mediates the formation of the structural property importance, which in turn influences the formation of additional structural properties that subsequently impact attitude consequences such as fan loyalty. Based upon the proposed FAN Model, two directions for future research are offered for the systematic study of attitude formation among sport consumers. ?? 2004 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

The current study replicates and extends this line of inquiry by examining the mediating role of attachment, a process by which an individual moves from merely liking a team (attraction) to becoming loyal to a team (allegiance). Data (Collegiate N = 194; Collegiate and Professional N = 402, Favorite Sport Team N = 808) were collected to examine 13 benefits and attributes associated with liking a sport team, 3 attitude formation properties, and allegiance. A three-stage test of mediation using MLR revealed that attachment mediated the relationship between allegiance and Vicarious Achievement, Nostalgia, Star Player, Escape, Success, and Peer Group Acceptance. Results demonstrate that allegiance is the outcome of a process by which individuals develop stronger emotional reactions to, more functional knowledge about, and greater symbolic value for benefits and attributes associated with a sport team.},

Despite widespread acceptance of the media's influence on society, research has provided limited understanding on how a person's prior knowl- edge and direct experience (i.e., cognitive complexity) related to a sport object moderates the influence of media on behavior. The present study extends this line of inquiry by empirically examining the role sport editorials have on shaping social behavior towards a professional sport team among consumers with high and low levels of cognitive complexity. A repeated measure mixed experimental design was used to exam- ine the interaction between cognitive complexity and editorial type on social behavior toward a profes- sional baseball team (N = 154). These data revealed that complexity stabilized the sport editorial's influence and individuals with limited prior knowledge and direct experience were more susceptible to the editorial's bias. T he results highlight the importance of developing and maintaining beneficial and symbiotic rela- tionships with local and regional print media to shape general consumer behavior towards a sport organi- zation and players.},

A guiding principle in much of this research has focused on the nature of sport-related experiences and the benefits sport consumers derive from these experiences. This emphasis has generated new knowledge and insights into the needs and wants of sport consumers. Although these efforts have contributed to the field's understanding of SCB, the vast majority of this research has centered on psychological phenomena and the evaluative and affective components of these sport experiences. Approaches to this work have also narrowed, with SCB research predominately relying on cross-sectional studies and attitudinal surveys to collect information. This has resulted in limited findings that seldom account for how various situational or environmental factors might influence attitudinal data patterns at the individual and group level. This special issues seeks to deepen our understanding of SCB by providing seven papers that demonstrate or validate findings using multiple studies or data collections. Keywords:},

The time between successive scoring events follows an exponential distribution, with little memory between different scoring intervals. Using this random-walk picture that is augmented by features idiosyncratic to basketball, we account for a wide variety of statistical properties of scoring, such as the distribution of the score difference between opponents and the fraction of game time that one team is in the lead. By further including the heterogeneity of team strengths, we build a computational model that accounts for essentially all statistical features of game scoring data and season win/loss records of each team.},

Students typically have little problem with elementary aspects, but many find it very difficult to know how to structure more complex problems. They rarely have well-developed informal methods of grasping the essence of a problem nor do they have any intuition as to whether they are applying the right formula in the right way. Our approach is based on mathematical modelling, in which all stages of the modelling cycle, not just the calculation stage, can be included. We believe giving students problems which model real life helps them to develop a greater range of methods and intuitions than the standard approach does. We also believe that considering multiple representations simultaneously and using whole numbers (natural frequencies) as far as possible help students to grasp the essence of the analysis of a problem. The teacher's role in asking key questions is also a vital component.},

By using the latest technology-driven examples and assuming that other ones are already being used such as the “second screen” combination of watching TV and simultaneously using a smartphone or tablet for better statistics or social interaction, it is asserted that “being there” has become less imperative, as alternatives to watching matches live and in person at many sporting events have become in many cases better options.},

abstract = {The process of learning models from raw data typically requires a substantial amount of user input during the model initialization phase. We present an assistive visualization system which greatly reduces the load on the users and makes the process of model initialization and refinement more efficient, problem-driven, and engaging. Utilizing a sequence segmentation task with a Hidden Markov Model as an example, we assign each token in the sequence a feature vector based on its various properties within the sequence. These vectors are then clustered according to similarity, generating a layout of the individual tokens in form of a node link diagram where the length of the links is determined by the feature vector similarity. Users may then tune the weights of the feature vector components to improve the segmentation, which is visualized as a better separation of the clusters. Also, as individual clusters represent different classes, the user can now work at the cluster level to define token classes, instead of labelling one entry at time. Inconsistent entries visually identify themselves by locating at the periphery of clusters, and the user then helps refine the model by resolving these inconsistencies. Our system therefore makes efficient use of the knowledge of its users, only requesting user assistance for non-trivial data items. It so allows users to visually analyse data at a higher, more abstract level, improving scalability. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

In Experiment 1 we show that the reading time for the second sentence in such a pair is in part determined by the semantic distance between the two items to be integrated (vehicle and bus in this case). This result suggests that the information from the two sentences is integrated at the time of reading. Experiment 2 replicates the semantic distance effect in a situation where the two sentences are separated in the text. In Experiment-3 and 4 it is shown that the effect can be abolished under conditions where the two items appear in unrelated phrases.

Using a combination of traditional cross-sectional surveys, a unique panel survey (in terms of scale, frequency, and source), and a high response rate panel, we find that daily sample composition varied more in response to campaign events than did vote intentions. Multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) is used to correct for this selection bias. Demographic post-stratification, similar to that used in most academic and media polls, is inadequate, but the addition of attitudinal variables (party identification, ideological self-placement, and past vote) appears to make selection ignorable in our data. We conclude that vote swings in 2012 were mostly sample artifacts and that real swings were quite small. While this account is at odds with most contemporaneous analyses, it better corresponds with our understanding of partisan polarization in modern American politics.},

We present here a set of goals for graphical displays discussed primarily from the statistical point of view and discuss some inherent contradictions in these goals that may be impeding communication between the fields of statistics and Infovis. One of our constructive suggestions, to Infovis practitioners and statisticians alike, is to try not to cram into a single graph what can be better displayed in two or more. We recognize that we offer only one perspective and intend this article to be a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion among graphic designers, statisticians, and users of statistical methods.

Keeping in mind how important spectators are for team sports, understanding factors that affect game attendance will offer essential clues in terms of increasing spectator attendance. The main purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between basketball spectators' motives and points of attachment. With consideration to this purpose, the present study has tested the validity and reliability of the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption and the Points of Attachment Index for Turkish basketball spectators. 197 basketball spectators participated in the study. Confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated that the original models of the measurement tools employed for the study showed an acceptable degree of fit with the data. The internal consistency coefficients of the scales were found to be between 0.59 and 0.80 for the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption and between 0.53 and 0.88 for the Points of Attachment Index. The canonical correlation analysis only returned a single significant function. The motives aesthetics and escape stood out in terms of the significant function, while the sport type (basketball in this study) stood out in the sense of attachment. Relationships identified between basketball spectators' motives and points of attachment could help sports managers and marketing experts to develop strategies focusing on increasing spectator attendance to their teams' games.},

They have emerged in such diverse fields as domain theory [1, 12], formal learning theory [14], epistemology and philosophy of science [9, 11, 7, 8, 2], statistics [5, 6] and modal logic [13, 4]. In those applications, open sets are typically interpreted as hypotheses deductively verifiable by true propositional information. However, in statistical data analysis problems one receives random samples logically compatible with every statistical hypothesis, so deductive verifiability does not literally apply. In this note, we lift the topological perspective to statistics by developing a tight formal analogy between statistical and propositional verifiability. In particular, we exhibit a topology on probability measures in which the open sets are exactly the statistically verifiable propositions. Furthermore, we extend that result to a topological characterization of learnability in the limit from statistical data. The Topology of Statistical Verifiability.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}To advance the study of digital politics it is urgent to complement data analytics with data hermeneutics to be understood as a methodological approach that focuses on the interpretation of the deep structures of meaning in social media conversations as they develop around various political phenomena, from digital protest movements to online election campaigns. The diffusion of Big Data techniques in recent scholarship on political behavior has led to a quantitative bias in the understanding of online political phenomena and a disregard for issues of content and meaning. To solve this problem it is necessary to adapt the hermeneutic approach to the conditions of social media communication, and shift its object of analysis from texts to datasets. On the one hand, this involves identifying procedures to select samples of social media posts out of datasets, so that they can be analysed in more depth. I describe three sampling strategies - top sampling, random sampling and zoom-in sampling - to attain this goal. On the other hand, “close reading” procedures used in hermeneutic analysis need to be adapted to the different quality of digital objects vis-{\`{a}}-vis traditional texts. This can be achieved by analysing posts not only as data-points in a dataset, but also as interventions in a collective conversation, and as utterances of broader “discourses”. The task of interpretation of social media data also requires an understanding of the political and social contexts in which digital political phenomena unfold, as well as taking into account the subjective viewpoints and motivations of those involved, which can be gained through in-depth interviews, and other qualitative social science methods. Data hermeneutics thus holds promise for a closing of the gap between quantitative and qualitative approaches in the study of digital politics, allowing for a deeper and more holistic understanding of online political phenomena.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Sport communication professionals use Twitter as one of the strategic tools of engagement, yet there remains a lack of understanding about how users are motivated and gratified in their Twitter use. Drawing on a specific sample from the Twitter followers of the Canadian Football League, the researchers used semistructured in-depth interviews, content analysis, and an online survey to seek an understanding of what motivates and satisfies Twitter followers of professional sport teams, measured through the gratifications sought and the fulfillment of these motives through the perceived gratifications obtained. The results add to the sport communications literature by finding 4 primary gratifications sought by Twitter users: interaction, promotion, live game updates, and news. Professional sport teams can improve strategic fan engagement by better understanding how Twitter followers use and seek gratification in the social-media experience. {\{}ABSTRACT{\}} {\{}FROM{\}} {\{}AUTHOR{\}}},

abstract = {Supporting comparison is a common and diverse challenge in visualization. Such support is difficult to design because solutions must address both the specifics of their scenario as well as the general issues of comparison. This paper aids designers by providing a strategy for considering those general issues. It presents four considerations that abstract comparison. These considerations identify issues and categorize solutions in a domain independent manner. The first considers how the common elements of comparison-a target set of items that are related and an action the user wants to perform on that relationship-are present in an analysis problem. The second considers why these elements lead to challenges because of their scale, in number of items, complexity of items, or complexity of relationship. The third considers what strategies address the identified scaling challenges, grouping solutions into three broad categories. The fourth considers which visual designs map to these strategies to provide solutions for a comparison analysis problem. In sequence, these considerations provide a process for developers to consider support for comparison in the design of visualization tools. Case studies show how these considerations can help in the design and evaluation of visualization solutions for comparison problems.},

abstract = {This paper examines the optimality of the shooting decisions of National Basketball Association (NBA) players using a rich data set of shot outcomes. The decision to shoot is a complex problem that involves weighing the continuation value of the possession and the outside option of a teammate shooting. We model this as a dynamic mixed-strategy equilibrium. At each second of the shot clock, dynamic efficiency requires that marginal shot value exceeds the continuation value of the possession. Allocative efficiency is the additional requirement that at that moment", each player in the line-up has equal marginal efficiency. To apply our abstract model to the data we make assumptions about the distribution of potential shots. We first assume nothing about the opportunity distribution and establish a strict necessary condition for optimality. Adding distributional assumptions, we establish sufficient conditions for optimality. Our results show that the cut threshold" declines monotonically with time remaining on the shot clock and is roughly in line with dynamic efficiency. Over-shooting is found to be rare, undershooting is frequently observed by elite players. We relate our work to the usage curve literature, showing that interior players face a generally steeper efficiency trade off when creating shots.},

abstract = {An important problem facing a basketball team is determining the right proportion of 2 and 3 point shots to take. With many possessions remaining, a team should maximize points—a 3-pointer is simply worth 1.5 2-pointers. 3-point attempts have roughly double the per-shot variance as 2-point attempts, but a team should be “risk neutral.” As time remaining decreases, the trailing team should place an increasingly positive value on risk; the opposite holds for the leading team. Our game theoretic analysis yields a testable optimality condition: 3-point success rate must fall relative to 2-point success rate when a team's preference for risk increases. Using four years of play-by-play data, we find strong evidence this condition holds for the trailing team only. As a lead decreases, the leading team should become more risk-neutral, but teams in this circumstance actually tighten up and become more risk averse, contrary to what their risk preferences ought to be to maximize the chance of winning the game. We also show that if the offense shoots more 3's as it becomes risk-loving this implies the attack can be varied more readily than the defensive adjustment. 3-point usage does increase with the trail team's preference for risk, but actually falls for the leading team. Teams get it right when losing and wrong when winning. We also find a strong motivating effect of losing—the trailing teams displays an overall boost in efficiency for both shot types.},

abstract = {The first free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) development communities were composed almost exclusively of volunteers. They were individuals who, despite their affiliation, contributed to the project on their own. They decided which project to join, and their contributions were personal in nature, even when in some cases they were employees of companies with some interests in the project. GNU, the first of such communities, and some others that emerged during the late 1980s and 1990s, followed this pattern. During the 1990s corporate interests started to have a role in some FLOSS communities. Companies hired people from those communities to gain influence, or tasked their employees to contribute to them, again with the idea of influencing their decisions. During the 2000s, corporate communities, in which companies are first-class citizens, have emerged, changing the rules and redefining the role of volunteers and non-affiliated individuals. However, the role of developers, with independence of the company for which they work, is still important even in these communities. This paper addresses this transition from volunteer-based to company-based development communities, and explores the structure and behavior of the latter.},

abstract = {The idea of places set apart for experiment was well established by the early nineteenth century. Then, as now, some types of experiment could be made only at the site of special equipment, while others could be made only in unusually large spaces.1 Still others, such as the mapping of geomagnetic phenomena or testing the effectiveness of a vaccine, could not be made within the confines of a building at all.2 The legitimacy of reducing the scale of natural phenomena to get them inside the laboratory and of reproducing them by artificial means was still contested during the last century.3 None the less, natural science — already associated with ‘the laboratory' — became increasingly identified with it during the nineteenth century. The importance of laboratory work to the development of science, to deciding technical issues in legal proceedings, to industry and to national security was widely accepted. The nation needed science and scientists needed places to conduct experiments.4 A book about such places would not be complete without an account of experimentation in them. This chapter addresses the recovery of experimental activity rather than the social, epistemological, architectural or other characteristics of the space in which it took place. My examples are a public trial by John Herschel in the lecture theatre of the London Institution in 1823 and some private, exploratory work done by Faraday in the basement laboratory in which he assisted Humphry Davy and Thomas Brande at the Royal Institution in 1821.},

Visualisations are increasingly seen as powerful tools to engage users with unfamiliar and complex subject matter. Despite recent research advances, scientists are yet to fully harness the potential of visualisation when interacting with non-scientists. To address this issue, we review the main principles of visualisation, discuss specific graphical challenges for environmental science and highlight some best practice from non-professional contexts. We provide a design framework to enhance the communication and application of scientific information within professional contexts. These guidelines can help scientists incorporate effective visualisations within improved dissemination and knowledge exchange platforms. We conclude that the uptake of science within environmental decision-making requires a highly iterative and collaborative design approach towards the development of tailored visualisations. This enables users to not only generate actionable understanding but also explore information on their own terms.},

abstract = {It remains challenging for information visualization novices to rapidly construct visualizations during exploratory data analysis. We conducted an exploratory laboratory study in which information visualization novices explored fictitious sales data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who rapidly constructed the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process.},

abstract = {The primary goal of visual data exploration tools is to enable the discovery of new insights. To justify and reproduce insights, the discovery process needs to be documented and communicated. A common approach to documenting and presenting findings is to capture visualizations as images or videos. Images, however, are insufficient for telling the story of a visual discovery, as they lack full provenance information and context. Videos are difficult to produce and edit, particularly due to the non-linear nature of the exploratory process. Most importantly, however, neither approach provides the opportunity to return to any point in the exploration in order to review the state of the visualization in detail or to conduct additional analyses. In this paper we present CLUE (Capture, Label, Understand, Explain), a model that tightly integrates data exploration and presentation of discoveries. Based on provenance data captured during the exploration process, users can extract key steps, add annotations, and author “Vistories”, visual stories based on the history of the exploration. These Vistories can be shared for others to view, but also to retrace and extend the original analysis. We discuss how the CLUE approach can be integrated into visualization tools and provide a prototype implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the general applicability of the model in two usage scenarios: a Gapminder-inspired visualization to explore public health data and an example from molecular biology that illustrates how Vistories could be used in scientific journals.},

abstract = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed dat- asets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single data- center significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× − 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15{\%}−64{\%} compared to existing baselines.},

abstract = {We test for a “hot hand” (i.e., short-term predictability in performance) in Major League Baseball using panel data. We find strong evidence for its existence in all ten statistical categories we consider. The magnitudes are significant; being “hot” corresponds to between one-half and one standard deviation in the distribution of player abilities. Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot-hand literature, which has found little to no evidence for a hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for transferring defensive resources to equate shooting probabilities across players whereas baseball does not. We then document that baseball teams do respond to recent success in their opponents' batting performance. Our results suggest that teams use recent performance in a manner consistent with drawing a correct inference about the magnitude of the hot-hand, except for a tendency to overreact to very recent performance (i.e., the last 5 attempts).},

abstract = {It is well known that visual analytics addresses the difficulty of evaluating and processing large quantities of information. Less often discussed are the increasingly complex analytic and reasoning processes that must be applied in order to accomplish that goal. Success of the visual analytics approach will require us to develop new visualization models that predict how computational processes might facilitate human insight and guide the flow of human reasoning. In this paper, we seek to advance visualization methods by proposing a framework for human "higher cognition" that extends more familiar perceptual models. Based on this approach, we suggest guidelines for the development of visual interfaces that better integrate complementary capabilities of humans and computers. Although many of these recommendations are novel, some can be found in existing visual analytics applications. In the latter case, much of the value of our contribution lies in the deeper rationale that the model provides for those principles. Lastly, we assess these visual analytics guidelines through the evaluation of several visualization examples. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {A substantial body of research supports a dual-process theory of moral judgment, according to which characteristically deontological judgments are driven by automatic emotional responses, while characteristically utilitarian judgments are driven by controlled cognitive processes. This theory was initially supported by neuroimaging and reaction time (RT) data. McGuire et al. have reanalyzed these initial RT data and claim that, in light of their findings, the dual-process theory of moral judgment and the personal/impersonal distinction now lack support. While McGuire and colleagues have convincingly overturned Greene et al.'s interpretation of their original RT data, their claim that the dual-process theory now lacks support overstates the implications of their findings. McGuire and colleagues ignore the results of several more recent behavioral studies, including the study that bears most directly on their critique. They dismiss without adequate justification the results of a more recent neuroimaging study, three more recent patient studies, and an emotion-induction study. Their broader critique is based largely on their conflation of the dual-process theory with the personal/impersonal distinction, which are independent. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In some cases people judge it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person's life in order to save several other lives, while in other similar cases they make the opposite judgment. Researchers have identified two general factors that may explain this phenomenon at the stimulus level: (1) the agent's intention (i.e. whether the harmful event is intended as a means or merely foreseen as a side-effect) and (2) whether the agent harms the victim in a manner that is relatively "direct" or "personal". Here we integrate these two classes of findings. Two experiments examine a novel personalness/directness factor that we call personal force, present when the force that directly impacts the victim is generated by the agent's muscles (e.g., in pushing). Experiments 1a and b demonstrate the influence of personal force on moral judgment, distinguishing it from physical contact and spatial proximity. Experiments 2a and b demonstrate an interaction between personal force and intention, whereby the effect of personal force depends entirely on intention. These studies also introduce a method for controlling for people's real-world expectations in decisions involving potentially unrealistic hypothetical dilemmas. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Traditional theories of moral development emphasize the role of controlled cognition in mature moral judgment, while a more recent trend emphasizes intuitive and emotional processes. Here we test a dual-process theory synthesizing these perspectives. More specifically, our theory associates utilitarian moral judgment (approving of harmful actions that maximize good consequences) with controlled cognitive processes and associates non-utilitarian moral judgment with automatic emotional responses. Consistent with this theory, we find that a cognitive load manipulation selectively interferes with utilitarian judgment. This interference effect provides direct evidence for the influence of controlled cognitive processes in moral judgment, and utilitarian moral judgment more specifically. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The thesis is aimed at the analysis and design of new methods and tools for processing semantic data, robust enough to be used by users even with very low IT or Semantic Web knowledge. The exploitation of semantics intersects with different areas of informatics – the acquisition can use methods from natural language processing, computer graphics, or computer vision. We can utilize visualization methods and e-learning processes to ensure transfer of semantic information to the user. Existing methods are often researched in specialized domain without any overlap or utilization of the others. But profitability of using semantics de- creases significantly in real-life usage due to such specialization. Automatic general semantic segmentation of computer vision has interesting outputs, but inapplicable in nearly-real-time environment of user applications, for example. The related technologies and existing approaches to general semantic processing will be described in this dissertation – the methods of acquiring and visualizing the semantic data in particular. The usability in e-learning and other real-world scenarios is discussed, as well as potential of combining less demanding methods to achieve more complex goals. Selected ways to visualize semantic data (and semantically-described data) are described. A more robust, semi-automatic method for visualization, and also methods capable to aid the preparation of the semantic visualiza- tion, the style-sheeting, have been designed and will be presented. The semantic annotation and semantic annotation of the image data is further discussed in this thesis – the process requirements, user interface structure, ontological structures, etc. A framework of semantic-aware tools developed as a part of this effort is also presented, as it served for utilization of the described methods.},

abstract = {The aim of this research essay is to examine the structural nature of theory in Information Systems. Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that encompass all theory types is advocated.},

This Article provides an explanation for why the prior literature misjudged the role that union dissolution would play during the 2011 work stoppages. It argues that previous commentators failed to recognize that the frequently cited disadvantages of dissolving a union actually provide minimal disincentive to players during a lockout.

abstract = {When comparing two trees, the most common tasks are to identify changes in the node values and to identify topological differences. However even in trees with just a dozen nodes it is difficult to see those differences. TreeVersity is a novel interactive visualization that allows users to detect both node value changes and topological differences. TreeVersity uses dual comparison techniques (side-by-side and explicit differences) coupled with a tabular representation, to help users understand and explore the differences. It uses carefully-designed color palettes to show positive/negative, absolute, and relative value changes; and glyphs that preattentively show these changes and also highlight created and removed nodes. To illustrate the use of TreeVersity we compared 1) the 2012 and 2013 U.S. Federal Budget and 2) airlines maintenance budgets. In a usability test all eight participants were able to identify differences between trees without training and suggested improvements which were implemented. TreeVersity was also applied in a Facebook app called MySocialTree to navigate the news feed as a tree of friends. A survey of 15 users of MySocialTree suggested that they were able to understand and navigate TreeVersitys glyphs and found it useful.},

abstract = {We present results from an experiment aimed at using logs of interactions with a visual analytics application to better understand how interactions lead to insight generation. We performed an insight-based user study of a visual analytics application and ran post hoc quantitative analyses of participants' measured insight metrics and interaction logs. The quantitative analyses identified features of interaction that were correlated with insight characteristics, and we confirmed these findings using a qualitative analysis of video captured during the user study. Results of the experiment include design guidelines for the visual analytics application aimed at supporting insight generation. Furthermore, we demonstrated an analysis method using interaction logs that identified which interaction patterns led to insights, going beyond insight-based evaluations that only quantify insight characteristics. We also discuss choices and pitfalls encountered when applying this analysis method, such as the benefits and costs of applying an abstraction framework to application-specific actions before further analysis. Our method can be applied to evaluations of other visualization tools to inform the design of insight-promoting interactions and to better understand analyst behaviors.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of soccer players' passing ability focuses on descriptive statistics without considering the players' real contribution to the passing and ball possession strategy of their team. Which player is able to help the build-up of an attack, or to maintain the possession of the ball? We introduce a novel methodology called QPass to answer questions like these quantitatively. Based on the analysis of an entire season, we rank the players based on the intrinsic value of their passes using QPass. We derive an album of pass trajectories for different gaming styles. Our methodology reveals a quite counterintuitive paradigm: losing the ball possession could lead to better chances to win a game.},

abstract = {Context High school completion (HSC) is an established predictor of long-term morbidity and mortality. U.S. rates of HSC are substantially lower among students from low-income families and most racial/ethnic minority populations than students from high-income families and the non-Hispanic white population. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of programs to increase HSC and the potential of these programs to improve lifelong health among at-risk students. Evidence acquisition A search located a meta-analysis (search period 1985-2010/2011) on the effects of programs to increase HSC or General Educational Development (GED) diploma receipt; the meta-analysis was concordant with Community Guide definitions and methodologic standards. Programs were assessed separately for the general student population (152 studies) and students who were parents or pregnant (15 studies). A search for studies published between 2010 and August 2012 located ten more recent studies, which were assessed for consistency with the meta-analysis. Analyses were conducted in 2013. Evidence synthesis The review focused on the meta-analysis. Program effectiveness was measured as the increased rate of HSC (or GED receipt) by the intervention group compared with controls. All assessed program types were effective in increasing HSC in the general student population: vocational training, alternative schooling, social-emotional skills training, college-oriented programming, mentoring and counseling, supplemental academic services, school and class restructuring, multiservice packages, attendance monitoring and contingencies, community service, and case management. For students who had children or were pregnant, attendance monitoring and multiservice packages were effective. Ten studies published after the search period for the meta-analysis were consistent with its findings. Conclusions There is strong evidence that a variety of HSC programs can improve high school or GED completion rates. Because many programs are targeted to high-risk students and communities, they are likely to advance health equity.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the US, and yet most cases represent localized cancer for which the optimal treatment is unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests that the available treatment options, including surgery and conservative treatment, result in a similar prognosis for most men with localized prostate cancer. However, approximately 90{\%} of patients choose surgery over conservative treatment, despite the risk of severe side effects like erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Recent medical research suggests that a key reason is the lack of patient-centered tools that can effectively communicate person- alized risk information and enable them to make better health decisions. In this paper, we report the iterative design process and results of developing the PROgnosis Assessment for Conservative Treatment (PROACT) tool, a personalized health risk commu- nication tool for localized prostate cancer patients. PROACT utilizes two published clinical prediction models to communicate the patients' personalized risk estimates and compare treatment options. In collaboration with the Maine Medical Center, we conducted two rounds of evaluations with prostate cancer survivors and urologists to identify the design elements and narrative structure that effectively facilitate patient comprehension under emotional distress. Our results indicate that visualization can be an effective means to communicate complex risk information to patients with low numeracy and visual literacy. However, the visualizations need to be carefully chosen to balance readability with ease of comprehension. In addition, due to patients' charged emotional state, an intuitive narrative},

The current study examined Twitter use among professional athletes who use Twitter to communicate with fans and other players. The study used content analysis to place 1,962 tweets by professional athletes into one of six categories: interactivity, diversion, information sharing, content, promotional, and fanship. Many of the tweets fell into the interactivity category (34{\%}). Athletes used Twitter to converse directly with their followers. Those with the most followers had more interactivity tweets. A large percentage of tweets (28{\%}) fell into the diversion category, because many of the tweets involved non-sports-related topics, and relatively few of the tweets (15{\%}) involved players discussing their own teams or sports. In addition, only 5{\%} of the tweets were promotional in nature, indicating that professional athletes may not be taking advantage of the promotional opportunities Twitter may provide.},

To this end, we use a dynamic programming based approach that varies over a continuum of being maximally to minimally greedy in terms of the number of paths explored at each iteration. We present an end-to-end sports visualization framework that employs our proposed algorithm-class. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework by testing it on 60,000 frames of soccer footage captured over 5 different illumination conditions, play types, and team attire.},

Tracing the gendered roots of science in culture, Donna Haraway's writings about scientific research on monkeys and apes is arguably the fmest scholarship in this tradition. She has carefully studied the publications, the papers, the correspondence, and the history of the expeditions and institu- tions of primate studies, uncovering the historical construction of the pedigrees for existing social relations - the naturalization of race, sex, and class. Throughout this book she is analysing accounts, narratives, and stories of the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs (cybernetic organ- isms: systems which embrace organic and technological components). She also looks critically at the immune system as an information system, and shows how deeply our cultural assumptions penetrate into allegedly value- neutral medical research. In several of these essays she explores and develops the contested terms of reference of existing feminist scholarship; and by mapping the fate of two potent and ambiguous words - 'nature' and 'experience' - she uncovers new visions and provides the possibility of a new politics of hope},

Previous approaches to similar problems center on hand-crafting features to capture domain specific knowledge. Although intuitive, recent work in deep learning has shown this approach is prone to missing important predictive features. To circumvent this issue, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially represent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature of basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN. Additionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we use "fading." By using gradient ascent, we were able to discover what the CNN filters look for during training. Last, we find that a combined FNN+CNN is the best performing network with an error rate of 26{\%}.},

The findings indicate that fans' responses towards an athlete include media following, creating their own narratives, positive word-of-mouth, and resistance to changing a favourite athlete. In addition, responses to the athlete's team include potential team substitution when the athlete is transferred, support for multiple teams and increased revenue generation. Finally, the sponsors of the athletes may also have benefits among fans including brand recognition, positive image, purchase intentions and ignoring rival sponsors. The implications of these findings for building and managing an athlete's brand are discussed, and directions for future studies are provided.},

@article{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book.

abstract = {Headlines are particularly important for online news out- lets where there are many similar news stories competing for users' attention. Traditionally, journalists have followed rules-of-thumb and experience to master the art of crafting catchy headlines, but with the valuable resource of large- scale click-through data of online news articles, we can apply quantitative analysis and text mining techniques to acquire an in-depth understanding of headlines. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis and modeling of 150Knews ar- ticles published over a period of four months on the Yahoo home page. We define a simple method to measure click- value of individual words, and analyze how temporal trends and linguistic attributes affect click-through rate (CTR).We then propose a novel generative model, headline click-based topic model (HCTM), that extends latent Dirichlet alloca- tion (LDA) to reveal the effect of topical context on the click-value of words in headlines. HCTM leverages clicks in aggregate on previously published headlines to identify words for headlines that will generate more clicks in the future. We show that by jointly taking topics and clicks into account we can detect changes in user interests within topics. We evaluate HCTM in two different experimental settings and compare its performance with ALDA (adapted LDA), LDA, and TextRank. The first task, full headline, is to retrieve full headline used for a news article given the body of news article. The second task, good headline, is to specifically identify words in the headline that have high click values for current news audience. For full headline task, our model performs on par with ALDA, a state-of-the art web-page summarization method that utilizes click-through information. For good headline task, which is of more prac- tical importance to both individual journalists and online news outlets, our model significantly outperforms all other comparative methods.},

abstract = {We investigated the task of predicting the outcomes of sporting events, in particular, basketball games. In two experiments, college students predicted the outcomes of a series of National Basketball Association (NBA) games. Following each prediction, the subject received feedback in the form of the actual outcome of the NBA game. After a period of initial learning about the relative strengths of the teams, the subjects were surprisingly successful in their predictions. We examined expert-novice differences by comparing the published predictions of professional oddsmakers to the predictions of the experimental subjects. The average predictions by the subjects were approximately as accurate as the predictions of experts. Finally, we applied a mathematical model, developed originally as an account of simpler learning experiments, to the subjects' responses. We found that the course of the subjects' learning about the teams was well-described by this model. People are able to learn about the structure of a domain by putting together sources of partial information. For example, it is possible to discover the hierarchical structure of an organization or large family by observing pairwise interactions between mem-bers of the organization or family. Likewise, people can infer a linear ordering or ranking of objects along a single dimension by merely observing the outcomes of comparisons or contests between pairs of objects or participants. One type of linear order arises in dominance hierarchies, where the members of a set compete against each other for some scarce resource, and the winner is determined probabilistically from his or her quality along some dimension such as speed, power, or ability. The clearest cases of this kind occur in sports in which individual players or teams compete repeatedly, with an explicit winner and margin of victory. This description would apply to rankings of professional tennis players, boxers, track runners, and},

abstract = {External information search behaviour has long been of interest to consumer researchers. Experimental and post hoc survey research methodologies have typically used a large number of variables to record search activity. However, as these are usually considered in aggregate, there is little opportunity for the researcher to overview the search style of a consumer. To date, the diagrammatic illustration of search behaviour has been limited to experimental environments in which the available information was strictly bounded, for example, within databases or when information display boards have been used. This paper, which focuses largely on inter-site world wide web (WWW) search behaviour, discusses web search paradigms and the variables used to capture WWW search. It also provides a conceptual framework for the representation of external information search behaviour in diagrammatic form. The technique o!ers researchers an opportunity to holistically interpret information search data and search styles. The bene"ts include the identi"cation of particular search styles, more precise interpretation of web search activity numeric data and the potential application for the training of web users to improve their search e!ectiveness.},

This article details methods developed for Kaggle's March Machine Learning Mania competition for the 2014 NCAA tournament. A submission to the competition consists of outcome probabilities for each potential matchup. Most predictive models are based entirely on measures of overall team strength, resulting in the unintended “transitive property.” These models are therefore unable to capture specific matchup tendencies. We introduce our novel nearest-neighbor matchup effects framework, which presents a flexible way to account for team characteristics above and beyond team strength that may influence game outcomes. In particular we develop a general framework that couples a model predicting a point spread with a clustering procedure that borrows strength from games similar to a current matchup. This results in a model capable of issuing predictions controlling for team strength and that capture specific matchup characteristics.},

abstract = {In contemporary society, data representation is an important and es- sential part of many aspects of our daily lives. This thesis aims to contribute to our understanding on how people experience data and what role representational modality plays in the process of percep- tion and interpretation. This research is grounded in phenomenol- ogy - I align my theoretical exploration to ideas and concepts from philosophical phenomenology, while also respecting the essence of a phenomenological approach in the choice and application of meth- ods. Alongside offering a rich description of people's experience of data representation, the key contributions I claim transcend four ar- eas: theory, methods, design, and empirical findings. From a theoreti- cal perspective, besides describing a phenomenology of human-data relations, I define, for the first time, multisensory data representation and establish a design space for the study of this class of representa- tion. In relation to methodologies, I describe and deploy two methods to investigate different aspects of data experience. I blend the Reper- tory Grid technique with a focus group session and show how this adaption can be used to elicit rich design relevant insight. I also in- troduce the Elicitation Interview technique as a method for gathering detailed and precise accounts of human experience. Furthermore, I describe for the first time, how this technique can be used to elicit accounts of experience with data. My contribution to design relates to the creation of a series of bespoke data-driven artefacts, as well as describing an approach to design that I call Design Probes, which al- lows researchers to focus their enquiry on specific design features. To answer the research questions I set out in this thesis, I report on a se- ries of empirical studies that used the aforementioned methods. The findings of these studies show, for instance, how certain representa- tional modalities cause us to have heightened awareness of our body, some are more difficult to interpret than others, some rely heavily on instinct and each of them solicit us to reference external events dur- ing the process of interpretation. I conclude that a phenomenology of human-data relations showhowrepresentational modality affects the way we experience data, it also shows how this experience unfolds and it offers insight into particular moments such as the formation of meaning. ix},

abstract = {People involved in close interpersonal relationships often develop a transactive memory system – a division of cognitive labor with respect to the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information from different substantive domains. The present study examined transactive memory systems using a sample of clerical office workers in a laboratory setting. It tested the general hypothesis that individual learning in work relationships is affected by perceptions of the relative expertise of coworkers. Participants were told that they would work on a task with a partner who had either similar or different work-related knowledge and job responsibilities. The findings supported the hypotheses that (a) people learn and recall more information in their own areas of expertise when their partner has different rather than similar work-related expertise; and (b) this effect reverses for recall of information outside work-related expertise. Taken together, the data showed that transactive memory is a property of work relationships, not just romantic relationships, and that role-based expertise can serve as its basis.

From an SEI perspective, there is value in scientists being aware of the need to make explicit the uncertainties that always exist in scientific and technological research and development. By the end of the class, a majority of the students felt that risks and ethical issues are not well understood by scientists working in nanomaterials, and ethical training was recommended for these scientists. Findings from this study speak to the importance of this type of interdisciplinary class in preparing students for collaborative research and making them aware of issues important to the general public who someday will become consumers of products derived from nanotechnology research.},

In this paper, we confront such features and address the need to: (i) use all relevant sample information; (ii) reflect the home game advantage. To do so we use the weighted likelihood. Finally we demonstrate the value of the method by showing how it could have been used to predict the 96/97 NBA playoff results. Our weighted likelihood-based method proves to be quite accurate.},

abstract = {Data surrounds each and every one of us in our daily lives, ranging from exercise logs, to archives of our interactions with others on social media, to online resources pertaining to our hobbies. There is enormous potential for us to use these data to understand ourselves better and make positive changes in our lives. Visualization (Vis) and Visual Analytics (VA) offer substantial opportunities to help individuals gain insights about themselves, their communities and their interests; however, designing tools to support data analysis in non-professional life brings a unique set of research and design challenges. We investigate the requirements and research directions required to take full advantage of Vis and VA in a personal context. We develop a taxonomy of design dimensions to provide a coherent vocabulary for discussing Personal Visualization and Personal Visual Analytics. By identifying and exploring clusters in the design space, we discuss challenges and share perspectives on future research. This work brings together research that was previously scattered across disciplines. Our goal is to call research attention to this space and engage researchers to explore the enabling techniques and technology that will support people to better understand data relevant to their personal lives, interests, and needs.},

abstract = {Open-source processes are based on the paradigm of self-organized communities as opposed to traditional hierarchical teams. These processes have not only been successful in the software development domain, but are increasingly being used in the development of physical products. In order to successfully adapt open-source processes to product realization there is a need to understand how open-source communities self-organize and how that impacts the development of the products. Towards the direction of fulfilling this need, we present an analysis of an existing open-source community involved in developing a web-based content-management platform, Drupal. The approach is based on the analysis of networks using techniques such as social network analysis, degree distribution, and hierarchical clustering. Openly available information on the Drupal website is utilized to perform the analysis of the community. The data is transformed into two weighted undirected networks: networks of people and networks of Drupal modules. Both the structure of these networks and their evolution during the past six years are studied. The networks are visualized by mapping them into images. Based on the analysis, it is observed that the structure of the Drupal community has the characteristics of a scale-free network, which is similar to many other complex networks in diverse domains. Finally, key trends in the evolution of the networks are identified and the possible explanations for those trends are discussed.},

abstract = {Visualizations have numerous benefits for problem solving, sense mak- ing, decision making, learning, analytical reasoning, and other high-level cognitive activities. Research in cognitive science has demonstrated that visualizations fun- damentally influence cognitive processing and the overall performance of such aforementioned activities. However, although researchers often suggest that visu- alizations support, enhance, and/or amplify cognition, little research has examined the cognitive utility of different visualizations in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Rather, visualization research is often focused only on low-level cognitive and perceptual issues. To design visualizations that effectively support high-level cognitive activities, a strong understanding of the cognitive effects of different visual forms is required. To examine thisissue, this chapter draws on research from a number of relevant domains, including information and data visualization, visual analytics, cognitive and perceptual psychology, and diagrammatic reasoning. This chapter identifies and clarifies some important terms and discusses the current state of research and practice. In addition, a number of common visualizations are identified, their cognitive and perceptual influences are examined, and some implications for the performance of high-level cognitive activities are discussed. Readers from various fields in which a human-centered approach to visualization is necessary, such as health informatics, data and information visualization, visual analytics, journalism, education, and human-information interaction,will likely find this chapter a useful reference for research, design, and/or evaluation purposes.},

abstract = {Online data journalism, including visualizations and other manifestations of data stories, has seen a recent surge of interest. User comments add a dynamic, social layer to in- terpretation, enabling users to learn from others' observa- tions and social interact around news issues. We present the results of a qualitative study of commenting around visuali- zations published on a mainstream news outlet, The Econ- omist's Graphic Detail blog. We find that surprisingly, only 42{\%} of the comments discuss the visualization and/or arti- cle content. Over 60{\%} of comments discuss matters of con- text, including how the issue is framed and the relation to outside data. Further, over one third of total comments pro- vide direct critical feedback on the content of presented visualizations and text articles as well as on contextual as- pects of the presentation. Our findings suggest using critical social feedback from comments in the design process, and motivate the development of more sophisticated comment- ing interfaces that distinguish comments by reference.

Despite the fact that our models can be used to make forecasts of elections earlier than existing models and they do not use data from polls on voting intentions, our models have lower out-of-sample forecasting errors than existing models. Our models also provide early and accurate probabilities of victory. We obtain this accuracy by constructing new methods of incorporating various economic and political indicators into forecasting models. We also obtain new results about the relative importance of approval ratings, economic indicators, and midterm effects in the different types of races, how economic data can be most meaningfully incorporated in forecasting models, the effects of different types of candidate experience on election outcomes, and that second quarter data is as predictive of election outcomes as third quarter data. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Consequently, it is not surprising that researchers have discovered that terrorism influences vote choice in individual nation states as well as impacts voter turnout cross-nationally. However, while scholars have analyzed the influence terrorism has on political behavior at the nation-state level, researchers do not currently understand how terrorism affects voter turnout in the specific urban centers where terrorist attacks occur. Thus, we examine the effect the number, severity, and types of terrorist attacks have on voter turnout in seven large urban centers in the United States from 1970 to 2012. The results indicate that terrorist attacks are nontrivial events that influence political behavior in the urban centers included in this analysis.},

Our analysis of research topics in visualization can, thus, serve as a starting point to (a) help create a common vocabulary to improve communication among different visualization sub-groups, (b) facilitate the process of understanding differences and commonalities of the various research sub-fields in visualization, (c) provide an understanding of emerging new research trends, (d) facilitate the crucial step of finding the right reviewers for research submissions, and (e) it can eventually lead to a comprehensive taxonomy of visualization research.

In spite of the challenges and uncertainty faced in this endeavor, patterns exist in how the seeds appear in each round, particularly the later rounds. This paper statistically analyzes tournaments from 1985 to 2010, finding that the distribution of seeds that win in the rounds beyond the Sweet Sixteen can be modeled as a truncated geometric random variable. This model allows one to consider any set of seeds in each tournament round and compute the probability that these seeds would win in that round; this methodology can evaluate the likelihood of each seed combination in each tournament round, based on past tournament history. Finally, each tournament from 1985 through 2010 is analyzed using this model to assess its likelihood and measure the probability of its occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We analyzed more than 150,000 microblog postings containing branding comments, sentiments, and opinions. We investigated the overall structure of these microblog postings, the types of expressions, and the movement in positive or negative sentiment. We compared automated methods of classifying sentiment in these microblogs with manual coding. Using a case study approach, we analyzed the range, frequency, timing, and content of tweets in a corporate account. Our research findings show that 19{\%} of microblogs contain mention of a brand. Of the branding microblogs, nearly 20{\%} contained some expression of brand sentiments. Of these, more than 50{\%} were positive and 33{\%} were critical of the company or product. Our comparison of automated and manual coding showed no significant differences between the two approaches. In analyzing microblogs for structure and composition, the linguistic structure of tweets approximate the linguistic patterns of natural language expressions. We find that microblogging is an online tool for customer word of mouth communications and discuss the implications for corporations using microblogging as part of their overall marketing strategy.},

abstract = {C urrent social cognition models of knowledge coordination based on transactive memory systems (TMS) theory have not generally considered conditions in which goals among partners are incongruent, and that those with specialized knowledge will not necessarily act to share their knowledge. As expected from previous literature, when facing a problem requiring inputs from others, an individual will draw on her personal or ego-centered network using the knowledge of her network's TMS; however, we theorize that the mixed motives within her network will cause the individual to also take into account her perception of the level of distrust within the network when combining the received knowledge from others in the network. Moreover, an individual's view of her network's TMS will be shaped not by specific policies or enforcement mechanisms, but by semistructures for how knowledge is disseminated, owned, and discussed. Our theory is supported based on a survey of security professionals responding to national security threats. The findings encourage a reexamina-tion of certain assumptions of TMS theory, as well as extending theories of ego-centered networks and social-cognitive information processing to include how individuals manage the knowledge-sharing/protection tension in interorganizational collaborations.},

abstract = {Scholars in science and technology studies (STS) have recently been called upon to advise governments on the design of procedures for public engagement. Any such instrumental function should be carried out consistently with STS's interpretive and normative obligations as a social science discipline. This article illustrates how such threefold integration can be achieved by reviewing current US participatory politics against a 70-year backdrop of tacit constitutional developments in governing science and technology. Two broad cycles of constitutional adjustment are discerned: the first enlarging the scope of state action as well as public participation, with liberalized rules of access and sympathetic judicial review; the second cutting back on the role of the state, fostering the rise of an academic-industrial complex for technology transfer, and privatizing value debates through increasing delegation to professional ethicists. New rules for public engagement in the United Sates should take account of these historical developments and seek to counteract some of the anti-democratic tendencies observable in recent decades.},

abstract = {Language is a complex system that evolves over time, due to several phenomena. In recent years, new communication media are affecting interpersonal written communication. In particular, mobile phones and internet-based communication media are leading people to use a small number of characters when writing messages. Hence, acronyms or abbreviations are used in most cases. In particular, a mobile phone message is usually composed by short phrases, the social network Twitter only allows 140 characters per message and in many online forums users have limited space for questions and answers. Although the use of acronyms dates back to ancient times, nowadays this type of linguistic sign is gaining prestige. In this work, we study the introduction of acronyms in social systems. In particular, we define a simple game for the purpose of analyzing how the use of an acronym spreads in a population, considering its ability to create a shared meaning. We performed many numerical simulations according to the proposed model, showing the creation of acronyms to be the result of collective dynamics in a population. 1},

abstract = {The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee annually selects its national championship tournament's at-large invitees, and assigns seeds to all participants. As part of its deliberations, the Committee is provided a so-called "nitty-gritty report" for each team, containing numerous team performance statistics. Many elements of this report receive a great deal of attention by the media and fans as the tournament nears, including a team's Ratings Percentage Index (or RPI), overall record, conference record, non-conference record, strength of schedule, record in its last 10 games, etc. However, few previous studies have evaluated the degree to which these factors are related to whether a team actually wins games once the tournament begins. Using nitty-gritty information for the participants in the 638 tournament games during the 10 seasons from 1999 through 2008, we use stepwise binary logit regression to build a model that includes only eight of the 32 nitty-gritty factors we examined. We find that in some cases factors that receive a great deal of attention are not related to game results, at least in the presence of the more highly related set of factors included in the model.

Furthermore, the National Basketball Association (NBA) is undergoing drastic change in terms of the way teams approach spatial issues as well as the spatio-temporal technologies and analytics. Given these facts, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide the opportunity to develop new analytic and visual methodologies to perform spatial analysis for team performances and meet the league's changing needs. This project thus develops new approaches, methods, and toolsets using GIS to demonstrate its efficacy and potential for professional application in the NBA. The first application uses GIS to adapt Relative Motion analysis techniques to an existing play, seeking to represent the average motion characteristics entailed therein. The other application uses a tool developed to map, glean spatial statistics, and model the use and importance of floor spacing for teams in the NBA.},

abstract = {Social media have become an increasingly important tool for college coaches and administrators to connect with fans, alumni, and recruits. However, despite their increasing prevalence, it is not well understood which factors may contribute to the reach and popularity in social media of high-profile figures such as coaches and athletic directors. Using Football Bowl Subdivision head football coaches and the popular social-media platform Twitter, this case study sought to explore the potential influence of on-field performance on coaches' popularity in social media. Among the results is the finding that the most influential factor is the football program's prestige (long-term success), while the coach's on-field success and the size of the school's fan base are of lesser importance. Given the increasing influence of social media in intercollegiate athletics, the case study's results feature several important considerations for administrators seeking to use social-media platforms to increase the reach of their athletic programs. {\{}ABSTRACT{\}} {\{}FROM{\}} {\{}AUTHOR{\}}},

Given their proprietary nature, investigations of sponsorship costs are particularly sparse. Therefore, this study utilizes a dataset of more than 700 sponsorships undertaken by competitors in the financial services industry to investigate the influence of a variety of factors on costs. Results indicate that costs are not simply reflective of firm size, and costs of title and naming rights sponsorships are significantly higher. Evidence of agency conflicts are found in increased costs for sponsor- ships of events, organizations, and venues residing within the marketers' home market. Sponsorships of sport organizations are significantly more costly than those of arts, enter- tainment, and nonprofit organizations, presenting a challenge for marketers seeking to engage today's consumer via sport sponsorships in an increasingly competitive environment.},

Consistent with prior applications of exchange theory to the sponsorship business-to-business relationship, results found sponsorships were most susceptible to dissolution within the first two renewal periods, and sponsorship durations differed significantly based on which methodology was applied.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how simultaneous use of devices such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones impacts the sponsors that receive brand integration during the broadcasts. Advances in technology now allow fans to consume broadcasts of televised events almost anywhere via personal computers, tablets and smartphones. These devices are also frequently utilized as “second screens” to communicate with fellow consumers on social media, access additional content or otherwise multitask during televised consumption. Design/methodology/approach: An initial study served to test the applicability of the theoretical framework of a dual coding theory in this new context, followed by a 3 × 2 between-subjects design utilized to advance understanding of the influence of second screens on brand awareness of the sponsors of televised events. Findings: Results demonstrated that both brand recognition and recall were reduced by second screen activity across nearly all audio or visual consumption experiences. Further, while second screen use in an audiovisual setting did not interfere with consumers' ability to recognize brands, indicating they were able to multitask and were not distracted, it inhibited their ability to recall brands from memory. This result provides evidence that second screen use may interfere with elaborative rehearsal and reduce cognitive capacity. Practical implications: Given that marketers are investing more resources than ever to achieve brand integration during televised events, these findings suggest that brands face challenges in achieving a requisite return on their investments. Originality/value: This study represents the first empirical investigation of the impact of consumers' use of second screens in the academic literature, and has important implications for the sponsors of televised events.},

abstract = {Researchers commonly use sports betting lines as predictions of the outcome of sporting events. Betting houses set betting lines conditional on bettors ex ante beliefs about game outcomes, which implies that the predictive power of the sports betting market could be an unintended consequence of betting house profit maximization. Using this insight, we propose a new test of the predictive power of the sports betting market, which incorporates a seldom-used piece of complementary betting information: the over/under—the predicted sum of scores for a game. Since the over/under has the same market properties as the betting line, it should be similarly predictive about the actual outcome, while if bettors have different beliefs about this game feature it need not be predictive. Using the universe of betting lines and over/unders on NFL, NBA, NCAA college football, and NCAA college basketball games from 2004-2010, we test the predictive power of the sports betting market in a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) structure that allows us to characterize both features of the betting market simultaneously. Our joint test reveals that while the betting line is an accurate predictor of the margin of victory the over/under is a poor predictor of the sum of scores. We consistently reject the hypothesis that the sports betting market overall functions well as a prediction market.},

abstract = {During speech acquisition, children form quick and rough hypotheses about the meaning of a new word after only a single exposure-a process dubbed "fast mapping." Here we provide evidence that a border collie, Rico, is able to fast map. Rico knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those items right away as well as 4 weeks after the initial exposure. Fast mapping thus appears to be mediated by general learning and memory mechanisms also found in other animals and not by a language acquisition device that is special to humans.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to extend brand identification theory to the sports team context by testing the direct and indirect effects of a sports team's personality, sports fans' identification with the team, and the effect of the length of fans' relationship with a team on their loyalty to it. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted a quantitative study among ice hockey fans of one Finnish hockey team before play-off games. Data came from an online questionnaire generating 1,166 responses. Findings – The authors find that: first, identification with a team mediates the effects of brand personality on attitudinal loyalty and behavioral loyalty; second, brand personality is a stronger driver of identification among newer fans; and third, brand personality has a stronger influence on both attitudinal and behavioral loyalty among newer fans. These findings stress the importance of sports brand's personality in driving fans' identification with the team and their loyalty to it. Originality/value – The study develops and tests a new conceptual model on consumer loyalty in the sports team context. The authors shed light on how sports team personality affects its fans' identification with the team and the formation of fan loyalty, from the perspective of fans' relationship length.},

abstract = {Models of human perception – including perceptual “laws” – can be valuable tools for deriving visualization design recommendations. However, it is important to assess the explanatory power of such models when using them to inform design. We present a secondary analysis of data previously used to rank the effectiveness of bivariate visualizations for assessing correlation (measured with Pearson's r) according to the well-known Weber-Fechner Law. Beginning with the model of Harrison et al. [1], we present a sequence of refinements including incorporation of individual differences, log transformation, censored regression, and adoption of Bayesian statistics. Our model incorporates all observations dropped from the original analysis, including data near ceilings caused by the data collection process and entire visualizations dropped due to large numbers of observations worse than chance. This model deviates from Weber's Law, but provides improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Using Bayesian credibility intervals, we derive a partial ranking that groups visualizations with similar performance, and we give precise estimates of the difference in performance between these groups. We find that compared to other visualizations, scatterplots are unique in combining low variance between individuals and high precision on both positively- and negatively- correlated data. We conclude with a discussion of the value of data sharing and replication, and share implications for modeling similar experimental data.},

We present a novel mobile in- terface design and visualization of uncertainty for transit predictions on mobile phones based on discrete outcomes. To develop it, we identified domain specific design re- quirements for visualizing uncertainty in transit prediction through: 1) a literature review, 2) a large survey of users of a popular realtime transit application, and 3) an iterative design process. We present several candidate visualizations of uncertainty for realtime transit predictions in a mobile context, and we propose a novel discrete representation of continuous outcomes designed for small screens, quantile dotplots. In a controlled experiment we find that quantile dotplots reduce the variance of probabilistic estimates by {\~{}}1.15 times compared to density plots and facilitate more confident estimation by end-users in the context of realtime transit prediction scenarios.

Neural networks derived from self-organizing maps established themselves as a useful tool to analyse static and temporal data. In this study, we applied the merge self-organising map (MSOM) to spatio-temporal data. To do so, we investigated the ability of MSOM's to analyse spatio-temporal data and compared its performance to the common dynamical controlled network (DyCoN) approach to analyse team sport position data. The position data of 10 players were recorded via the Ubisense tracking system during a basketball game. Furthermore, three different pre-selected plays were recorded for classification. Following data preparation, the different nets were trained with the data of the first half. The training success of both networks was evaluated by achieved entropy. The second half of the basketball game was presented to both nets for automatic classification. Both approaches were able to present the trained data extremely well and to detect the pre-selected plays correctly. In conclusion, MSOMs are a useful tool to analyse spatial-temporal data, especially in team sports. By their direct inclusion of different time length of tactical patterns, they open up new opportunities within team sports.},

Here, we introduce a novel experimental procedure to objectively measure human memory, allowing us to build LaMem, the largest annotated image memorability dataset to date (containing 60,000 images from diverse sources). Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we show that fine-tuned deep features outperform all other features by a large margin, reaching a rank correlation of 0.64, near human consistency (0.68). Analysis of the responses of the high-level CNN layers shows which objects and regions are positively, and negatively, correlated with memorability, al- lowing us to create memorability maps for each image and provide a concrete method to perform image memorability manipulation. This work demonstrates that one can now ro- bustly estimate the memorability of images from many dif- ferent classes, positioning memorability and deep memora- bility features as prime candidates to estimate the utility of information for cognitive systems.

abstract = {Sport consumers are increasingly discontented and disconnected with sport organizations and researchers have advocated a fundamental shift in sport marketing from a traditional exchange paradigm to a relationship paradigm. Relationship quality is critical to understanding sport consumer-organization relationships because it can: (a) render a platform to organize wide-ranging relational constructs; (b) provide insight into evaluating relationship-marketing effectiveness; and (c) diagnose and address problems in relationships. Therefore, we propose a conceptual framework of sport consumer- organization relationship quality that consists of three main components. First, we specify that relationship quality consists of five distinct but related relational constructs (trust, commitment, intimacy, self-connection, and reciprocity). Second, we suggest that relationship quality influences word of mouth, media consumption, licensed-product consumption, and attendance behaviors. Finally, we argue that psychographic factors such as relationship styles, relationship drive, and general interpersonal orientation are moderators, as well as demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, region, and income.},

abstract = {Hermeneutics has much to offer those interested in qualitative inquiry, and is especially suitable for work of a textual and interpretive nature, yet writings in hermeneutics are frequently viewed as dense and impenetrable, particularly to North American audiences and those unfamiliar with the Continental Philosophical tradition. Drawing on Hans Georg GADAMER, as well as other hermeneutic thinkers, an introductory overview of five characteristics of a hermeneutic approach is offered in this paper. Further, it is suggested that hermeneutics can fruitfully be partnered with a critical approach. In this regard, a critical attitude and a metaxological approach are explored and a conceptualization of critical hermeneutics is proposed. It is suggested that hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics implicitly underpin qualitative inquiry, both of which emphasize the interpretive act of understanding, and a dialogue on this subject is invited.},

abstract = {This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines. In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory', the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in understanding the impact of aging on face recognition performance, as well as designing recognition algorithms that are mostly invariant to temporal changes. While some success has been made on this front, a fundamental questions has yet to be answered: do face recognition systems that compensate for the effects of aging compromise recognition performance for faces that have not undergone any aging? The studies in this paper help confirm that age invariant systems do seem to decrease performance in non-aging scenarios. This is demonstrated by performing training experiments on the largest face aging dataset studied in the literature to date (over 200,000 images from roughly 64,000 subjects). Further experiments conducted in this research help demonstrate the impact of aging on two leading commercial face recognition systems. We also determine the regions of the face that remain the most stable over time.},

abstract = {A consensus map of science is generated from an analy- sis of 20 existing maps of science.These 20 maps occur in three basic forms: hierarchical, centric,and noncentric (or circular). The consensus map, generated from con- sensus edges that occur in at least half of the input maps, emerges in a circular form. The ordering of areas is as follows: mathematics is (arbitrarily) placed at the top of the circle, and is followed clockwise by physics, physical chemistry, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences, biol- ogy, biochemistry, infectious diseases, medicine, health services, brain research, psychology, humanities, social sciences, and computer science. The link between com- puter science and mathematics completes the circle. If the lowest weighted edges are pruned from this con- sensus circular map, a hierarchical map stretching from mathematics to social sciences results.The circular map of science is found to have a high level of correspon- dence with the 20 existing maps, and has a variety of advantages over hierarchical and centric forms. A one- dimensional Riemannian version of the consensus map is also proposed. Introduction},

In the 10–15 trading days after the onset of the scandal, the full portfolio of sponsors lost more than 2{\%} of market value, with losses concentrated among the core three sponsors: Electronic Arts, Nike, and PepsiCo (Gatorade). Sponsors' day-by-day losses correlate strongly with Google search intensity regarding the endorsement-related impact of the scandal, as well as with qualitative indicators of “endorsement-related news.” At least some sponsors' losses were competitors' gains, suggesting that endorsement deals are partially a business-stealing strategy. However, competitors who were themselves celebrity endorsement intensive fared relatively worse than those who were not endorsement intensive, and that difference also correlates day by day with news/search intensity regarding the scandal. It appears that the scandal sent a negative marketwide signal about the reputation risk associated with celebrity endorsements.},

Mildly favorable betting opportunities are revealed. More generally, the proposed methods offer a flexible approach to conditional density forecasting for a broad class of applications.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to determine whether basketball teams who choose to employ an offensive strategy that involves predominantly shooting three point shots is stable and optimal. We employ a game-theoretical approach using techniques from dynamical systems theory to show that taking more three point shots to a point where an offensive strategy is dependent on predominantly shooting threes is not necessarily optimal, and depends on a combination of payoff constraints, where one can establish conditions via the global stability of equilibrium points in addition to Nash equilibria where a predominant two-point offensive strategy would be optimal as well. We perform a detailed fixed-points analysis to establish the local stability of a given offensive strategy. We finally prove the existence of Nash equilibria via global stability techniques via the monotonicity principle. We believe that this work demonstrates that the concept that teams should attempt more three-point shots because a three-point shot is worth more than a two-point shot is therefore, a highly ambiguous statement.},

abstract = {In this paper, we employ machine learning techniques to analyze fifteen seasons of NBA regular season data from every team to determine the common characteristics among NBA playoff teams. Each team was characterized by 44 predictor variables and one binary response variable taking on a value of '"TRUE" if a team had made the playoffs, and value of "FALSE" if a team had missed the playoffs. After fitting an initial classification tree to this problem, this tree was then pruned which decreased the test error rate. Further to this, a random forest of classification trees was grown which provided a very accurate model from which a variable importance plot was generated to determine which predictor variables had the greatest influence on the response variable. The result of this work was the conclusion that the most important factors in characterizing a team's playoff eligibility are the opponent field goal percentage and the opponent points per game. This seems to suggest that defensive factors as opposed to offensive factors are the most important characteristics shared among NBA playoff teams.},

Research currently focuses on investigating this form of communication by using quantitative methods in order to get a better understanding of it and of its relevance for companies and society. However, little is known about how enterprises themselves spread information in social media and how stakeholders talk about brands and products. In our work, we investigate communication genres directed from stakeholder- to-stakeholder, from business-to-stakeholder, and from stakeholder-to-business. By doing this, we were able to broadly analyze the content of communication in social media. In our research, we focus on the company adidas, an international manufacturer of sports clothes. We concentrate on the awareness aspect and adapted a theoretical model in order to evaluate company- related communication in Twitter. Our case study includes 289,513 tweets which were collected on 60 consecutive days. In order to identify genres and to answer the research questions, we manually analyzed 500 randomly chosen tweets as well as all those tweets published by official corporate accounts. We come to the conclusion that communication in social media is indeed of high importance for adidas. Furthermore, we show that adidas enters the communication in Twitter strategically to increase the awareness of their products.},

The aim of this paper is to bring to a peer-reviewed journal the generally accepted basics of the analysis of basketball, thereby providing a common starting point for future research in basketball. The possession concept, in particular the concept of equal possessions for opponents in a game, is central to basketball analysis. Estimates of possessions have existed for approximately two decades, but the various formulas have sometimes created confusion. We hope that by showing how most previous formulas are special cases of our more general formulation, we shed light on the relationship between possessions and various statistics. Also, we hope that our new estimates can provide a common basis for future possession estimation. In addition to listing data sources for statistical research on basketball, we also discuss other concepts and methods, including offensive and defensive ratings, plays, per-minute statistics, pace adjustments, true shooting percentage, effective field goal percentage, rebound rates, Four Factors, plus/minus statistics, counterpart statistics, linear weights metrics, individual possession usage, individual efficiency, Pythagorean method, and Bell Curve method. This list is not an exhaustive list of methodologies used in the field, but we believe that they provide a set of tools that fit within the possession framework and form the basis of common conversations on statistical research in basketball.

abstract = {There's a "Frank {\&} Ernest" comic strip showing a chick breaking out of its shell, looking around, and saying, "Oh, wow! Paradigm shift!" Blame the late Thomas Kuhn. Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science-all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street. Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts-or the way his work has been used to cast doubt-on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift.

abstract = {The importance of team brand associations in sport management research is well documented, but the forma- tion and stability of these associations has not been investigated. The current research tested the development, change, and predictive ability of brand associations over time. Longitudinal quantitative data were collected from consumers of a new Australian Football League (AFL) team (N = 169) at 3 points in time. One-sample t-tests revealed that brand associations had developed through marketing communications and the launch of the team before the team had played its first AFL game. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance and latent growth modeling showed that brand associations changed over time, reflecting consumers' experiences with the team. A cross-lagged panel model highlighted that brand associations influenced consumer loyalty in the future. Consequently, sport managers are provided with insights on the development of and change in brand associations that new consumers link with sport teams},

abstract = {When team sports coaches instruct their team members, a sample video is needed for an offensive instruction. However, it is very difficult to search a video for the parts of interest, and it takes a long time to compile a database, for example, ball trajectories and player locations, because sports videos have many periods with no play such as timeouts. In particular, information on the ball trajectory is very important for tactical analysis. However, it is currently inputted manually, which is time-consuming. Therefore, we focus on American football, where the ball can rarely be seen. The contribution of this paper is the submission of a method of automatic ball trajectory extraction. First, we remove the no-play periods in team sports videos to leave only play time and reduce the processing time. Second, we extract the ball trajectory to enable tactical analysis. We propose a new approach to ball tracking by focusing on the ball holder prediction. Our method can be applied to situations with heavy occlusion. Finally, we construct a play search and 3D virtual display system using information on the ball trajectory and the Unity, which is the development environment of the 3D virtual visualization. We used it to construct a Virtual 3D map for watching the play from an arbitrary viewpoint.},

abstract = {Background—Discourse cohesion and coherence gives our communication continuity. Deficits in cohesion and coherence have been reported in patients with cognitive-communication disorders (e.g., TBI, dementia). However, the diffuse nature of pathology and widespread cognitive deficits of these disorders have made identification of specific neural substrates and cognitive systems critical for cohesion and coherence challenging. Aims—Taking advantage of a rare patient group with selective and severe declarative memory impairments, the current study attempts to isolate the contribution of declarative memory to the successful use of cohesion and coherence in discourse. Methods {\&} Procedures—Cohesion and coherence were examined in the discourse of six participants with hippocampal amnesia and six demographically matched comparison participants. Specifically, this study (1) documents the frequency, type, and completeness of cohesive ties; (2) evaluates discourse for local and global coherence; and (3) compares use of cohesive ties and coherence ratings in amnesia and healthy participants. Outcomes {\&} Results—Overall, amnesia participants produced fewer cohesive ties per T-unit, the adequacy of their ties were more often judged to be incomplete, and the ratings of their local coherence were consistently lower than comparison participants. Conclusions—These findings suggest that declarative memory may contribute to the discursive use of cohesion and coherence. Broader notions of cohesion, or cohesion across speakers (two or more people), time (days, weeks), and communicative resources (gesture), warrant further study as the experimental tasks used in the literature, and here, may actually underestimate or overestimate the extent of impairment.},

However, relatively little is known about consumer behavior in skill-based gaming situations (e.g., sports betting). In two studies, we investigated the overestimation phenomenon in the "March Madness" context. In Study 1 (N = 81), we found that individuals who were allowed to make their own predictions were significantly more optimistic about their performance than individuals who did not make their own selections. In Study 2 (N = 197), all subjects participated in a mock competitive bracket pool. In line with the illusion of control theory, results showed that higher self-ratings of probability of winning significantly increased maximum willingness to wager but did not improve actual performance. Lastly, perceptions of high probability of winning significantly contributed to consumers' enjoyment and willingness to participate in a bracket pool in the future.;},

The results revealed that message valence had a significant main impact on triggering biased source evaluation and attitude toward the message. In tum. media source had a significant main effect on source expertise, but no main effects were found for trustworthiness and attitude. Team identification moderated the effect of media source on cognitive processing, sug- gesting that highly identified fans evaluated mainstream content more favorably, whereas less identified fans preferred user-generated content.},

For example you may think that an automobile worth {\$}200,000 is better than one worth {\$}20,000, but the truth is that you wouldn't want a bus for your everyday rides. Correctly assessing the desirable traits of the object and also the importance of them, in order to label it as better than another is a difficult procedure, torturing the minds of many scientists. In the age of the World Wide Web, finding the best website for your needs created one of the biggest technology companies since the 70's. Although ranking is used in many cutting-edge technologies, it is also used in less mind-boggling themes, but produces equally thrilling emotions. In this paper, we compare the performance of linear algebra ranking algorithms (mHITS, Colley, Massey) to a machine learning approach(Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Random Forests) in the context of sports.},

Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are "metaphors we live by"—metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them.

abstract = {Science and technology have immense authority and influence in our society, yet their working remains little understood. The conventional perception of science in Western societies has been modified in recent years by the work of philosophers, sociologists and historians of science. In this book Bruno Latour brings together these different approaches to provide a lively and challenging analysis of science, demonstrating how social context and technical content are both essential to a proper understanding of scientific activity. Emphasizing that science can only be understood through its practice, the author examines science and technology in action: the role of scientific literature, the activities of laboratories, the institutional context of science in the modern world, and the means by which inventions and discoveries become accepted. From the study of scientific practice he develops an analysis of science as the building of networks. Throughout, Bruno Latour shows how a lively and realistic picture of science in action alters our conception of not only the natural sciences but also the social sciences and the sociology of knowledge in general. This stimulating book, drawing on a wealth of examples from a wide range of scientific activities, will interest all philosophers, sociologists and historians of science, scientists and engineers, and students of the philosophy of social science and the sociology of knowledge.},

It addresses the need to acknowledge a recently emerging number of visualization projects that combine information visualization techniques with principles of creative design. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of information aesthetics as a potentially independent research field within visualization that specifically focuses on the experience of aesthetics, dataset interpretation and interaction. The proposed model is based on analysing existing visualization techniques by their interpretative intent and data mapping inspiration. It reveals information aesthetics as the conceptual link between information visualization and visualization art, and includes the fields of social and ambient visualization. This model is unique in its focus on aesthetics as the artistic influence on the technical implementation and intended purpose of a visualization technique, rather than subjective aesthetic judgments of the visualization outcome. This research provides a framework for understanding aesthetics in visualization, and allows for new design guidelines and reviewing criteria.},

It notes, in consistency with the Foucauldian approach, that material semiotics implies that knowledge traditions are performative, helping to create the realities that they describe. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of this performatibity for the politics of research methods and for the future character of social science research.},

Even though visualization as a storytelling medium has recently begun to gain attention, storytelling is still underexplored in information visualization and little research has been done to help people tell their stories with data. To create a new, more engaging form of storytelling with data, we leverage and extend the narrative storytelling attributes of whiteboard animation with pen and touch interactions. We present SketchStory, a data-enabled digital whiteboard that facilitates the creation of personalized and expressive data charts quickly and easily. SketchStory recognizes a small set of sketch gestures for chart invocation, and automatically completes charts by synthesizing the visuals from the presenter-provided example icon and binding them to the underlying data. Furthermore, SketchStory allows the presenter to move and resize the completed data charts with touch, and filter the underlying data to facilitate interactive exploration. We conducted a controlled experiment for both audiences and presenters to compare SketchStory with a traditional presentation system, Microsoft PowerPoint. Results show that the audience is more engaged by presentations done with SketchStory than PowerPoint. Eighteen out of 24 audience participants preferred SketchStory to PowerPoint. Four out of five presenter participants also favored SketchStory despite the extra effort required for presentation.},

We collected data including audio/video record of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interview; and analyzed the data using the grounded theory method. The primary result of this study is a grounded model of NOvice's information VIsualization Sensemaking (NOVIS model), which consists of the five major cognitive activities: 1 encountering visualization, 2 constructing a frame, 3 exploring visualization, 4 questioning the frame, and 5 floundering on visualization. We introduce the NOVIS model by explaining the five activities with representative quotes from our participants. We also explore the dynamics in the model. Lastly, we compare with other existing models and share further research directions that arose from our observations.},

abstract = {— The Information Visualization community has begun to pay attention to visualization literacy; however, researchers still lack instruments for measuring the visualization literacy of users. In order to address this gap, we systematically developed a visual-ization literacy assessment test (VLAT), especially for non-expert users in data visualization, by following the established procedure of test development in Psychological and Educational Measurement: (1) Test Blueprint Construction, (2) Test Item Generation, (3) Content Validity Evaluation, (4) Test Tryout and Item Analysis, (5) Test Item Selection, and (6) Reliability Evaluation. The VLAT con-sists of 12 data visualizations and 53 multiple-choice test items that cover eight data visualization tasks. The test items in the VLAT were evaluated with respect to their essentialness by five domain experts in Information Visualization and Visual Analytics (average content validity ratio = 0.66). The VLAT was also tried out on a sample of 191 test takers and showed high reliability (reliability coeffi-cient omega = 0.76). In addition, we demonstrated the relationship between users' visualization literacy and aptitude for learning an unfamiliar visualization and showed that they had a fairly high positive relationship (correlation coefficient = 0.64). Finally, we discuss evidence for the validity of the VLAT and potential research areas that are related to the instrument.},

abstract = {Sports offer interesting insights into demand due to the added twist of fan preferences for outcome uncertainty. We add to and amend previous work by analyzing the time series behavior of Major League Baseball attendance (1901-2003) using break point analysis, exploring a wide variety of measures of game uncertainty, playoff uncertainty, and consecutive season uncertainty. Only playoff uncertainty is statistically significant, and it is economically significant only for (1) truly ambitious intervention and (2) recent history. The policy implication is that actual league choices may be motivated by wealth redistribution rather than concerns over competitive balance. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.},

abstract = {Today real-time sports performance analysis is a crucial aspect of matches in many major sports. For example, in soccer and rugby, team analysts may annotate videos during the matches by tagging specific actions and events, which typically result in some summary statistics and a large spreadsheet of recorded actions and events. To a coach, the summary statistics (e.g., the percentage of ball possession) lacks sufficient details, while reading the spreadsheet is time-consuming and making decisions based on the spreadsheet in real-time is thereby impossible. In this paper, we present a visualization solution to the current problem in real-time sports performance analysis. We adopt a glyph-based visual design to enable coaching staff and analysts to visualize actions and events "at a glance". We discuss the relative merits of metaphoric glyphs in comparison with other types of glyph designs in this particular application. We describe an algorithm for managing the glyph layout at different spatial scales in interactive visualization. We demonstrate the use of this technical approach through its application in rugby, for which we delivered the visualization software, MatchPad, on a tablet computer. The MatchPad was used by the Welsh Rugby Union during the Rugby World Cup 2011. It successfully helped coaching staff and team analysts to examine actions and events in detail whilst maintaining a clear overview of the match, and assisted in their decision making during the matches. It also allows coaches to convey crucial information back to the players in a visually-engaging manner to help improve their performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This paper presents the first steps toward such a system, with a focus on identifying the category of intended message of potentially relevant bar charts and line graphs.

Despite some pessimistic forecasts concerning the impact of social TV on viewing behaviors, broadcasters have found that the social TV phenomenon plays a positive role in boosting television ratings. We examine whether television viewers' backchannel communication during a mega-sporting event has a positive effect on their sports channel loyalty. A survey of a randomly drawn sample (N = 500) from national panel data in South Korea was conducted right after the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games. On the basis of theories in web interactivity, emotional attachment, and company-consumer identification, we proposed three levels of social TV engagement. Results of a confirmatory factor analysis yielded the tripartite dimensions of social media engagement (i.e.; functional, emotional, and communal) among viewers of social TV. A test of the structural equation model (SEM) revealed that functional engagement had a direct impact on social presence and that the communal engagement had a direct effect on channel loyalty. The effect of emotional engagement on channel loyalty was mediated by channel commitment. The social presence led to channel loyalty mediated by channel commitment.},

We implemented 5 different supervised learning classification models: Logistic Regression, SVM, aDaboost, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Using points score, field goals attempted, defensive rebounds, assists, turnovers, overall record, and recent record as features, we found that Random Forest could accurately predict the result 65.15{\%} of the time.

Given a set of categorical values and a target color palette, our algorithm matches each data value with a unique color. Values are mapped to colors by collecting representative images, analyzing image color distributions to determine value-color affinity scores, and choosing an optimal assignment. Our affinity score balances the probability of a color with how well it discriminates among data values. A controlled study shows that expert-chosen semantically-resonant colors improve speed on chart reading tasks compared to a standard palette, and that our algorithm selects colors that lead to similar gains. A second study verifies that our algorithm effectively selects colors across a variety of data categories.},

abstract = {The study investigated potential effects of the presentation order of numeric information on retrospective subjective judgments of descriptive statistics of this information. The studies were theoretically motivated by the assumption in the naive sampling model of independence between temporal encoding order of data in long-term memory and retrieval probability (i.e. as implied by a "random sampling" from memory metaphor). In Experiment 1, participants experienced Arabic numbers that varied in distribution shape/variability between the first and the second half of the information sequence. Results showed no effects of order on judgments of mean, variability or distribution shape. To strengthen the interpretation of these results, Experiment 2 used a repeated judgment procedure, with an initial judgment occurring prior to the change in distribution shape of the information half-way through data presentation. The results of Experiment 2 were in line with those from Experiment 1, and in addition showed that the act of making explicit judgments did not impair accuracy of later judgments, as would be suggested by an anchoring and insufficient adjustment strategy. Overall, the results indicated that participants were very responsive to the properties of the data while at the same time being more or less immune to order effects. The results were interpreted as being in line with the naive sampling models in which values are stored as exemplars and sampled randomly from long-term memory.},

Key articles and materials were obtained from MEDLINE{\textregistered} and PsychInfo{\textregistered} databases, from reference article citations, and from discussion with experts in risk communication. Research has been devoted primarily to communicating risk magnitudes. Among the various graphi- cal displays, the risk ladder appears to be a promising tool for communicating absolute and relative risks. Preliminary evidence suggests that people understand risk information presented in histograms and pie charts. Areas that need fur- ther attention include 1) applying theoretical models to the visual communication of risk, 2) testing which graphical dis- plays can be applied best to different risk communication tasks (e.g., which graphs best convey absolute or relative risks), 3) communicating risk uncertainty, and 4) testing whether the lay public's perceptions and understanding of risk varies by graphical format and whether the addition of graphical displays improves comprehension substantially beyond numerical or narrative translations of risk and, if so, by how much. There is a need to ascertain the extent to which graphics and other visuals enhance the public's un- derstanding of disease risk to facilitate decision-making and behavioral change processes. Nine suggestions are provided to help achieve these ends. [Monogr Natl Cancer Inst 1999; 25:149–63]},

abstract = {Anabolic Androgenic Steroids (AASs) are chemical and pharmacological derivatives of the male hormone testosterone which are widely used for increasing burst and sprinting activities in sports. Although AASs are thought to be transversal to the plurality of sports disciplines, they are principally misused by bodybuilders, weightlifters, shot, hammer, discus or javelin throwers, rugby and American football players as well as by swimmers and runners. AAS exert a kaleidoscope of effects on human biology, principally through the 5-$\alpha$-reductase-mediated conversion into dihydrotestosterone, the aromatase-mediated conversion into female sex hormones, a competitive antagonism to the glucocorticoid receptors, the potential stimulation of erythropoietin secretion as well as psychoactive effects on the brain. The influence of AASs on physical performance is still undefined, since the large number of studies published so far have described discordant and often contradictory outcomes. Nevertheless, animal and human investigations support the hypothesis that the administration of AASs might increase lean body mass, muscle mass, and maximal voluntary strength especially in men, so that they would represent an appealing form of doping for increasing power capacity, sustaining intensive training periods and, last but not least, as a cosmetic muscle makeover. The aim of this article is to review the biochemistry, physiology and the ergogenic effects of AASs.},

abstract = {While there is very little scholarship that has examined sport blog accounts of women's sport like that of the WNBA, there is a wealth of scholarship that has explored the ways in which women's sport is most frequently represented in traditional media outlets such as television, newspapers, and magazines. Scholarship on traditional media, gender, and sport reveals that female athletes such as those in the WNBA are often covered in norma- tive ways, that is, ways that highlight a particular form of femininity, motherhood, and sexuality while downplaying female athleticism (Banet-Weiser, 1999). Yet little is known about whether or not these representational strategies persist within the interactive world of new media blogs where fans have the opportunity to post their own interpretations of events in discussion board posts. This analysis begins to fi ll that gap by examining WNBA accounts to see if traditional media themes related to gender and sport are repre- sented within two sport news blogs with differing editorial foci: Deadspin and Wom- en Talk Sports. Our analysis suggests that dominant ideologies and representational patterns most frequently produced in traditional media accounts are often reproduced in Deadspin while Women Talk Sports offers a unique opportunity for more critical en- gagement with these ideologies.

We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective, interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for design, evaluation and theory development.},

Recent research, however, has moved beyond this perspective to examine how groups within and beyond the team identity influence consumption. Assimilating previous research findings, we advance a Multiple In-group Identity Framework (MIIF), which consists of three levels: (1) superordinate (e.g., team identity), (2) subgroup (e.g., specific stadium area), and (3) relational group (e.g., friends or family). In the MIIF, we conceptualise the complex array of groups to which a consumer may belong within a superordinate identity. Each level includes groups with varying degrees of inclusiveness, homogeneity, and interpersonal attachment to other consumers between members. Individuals seek out sub and relational group membership because solely identifying at the superordinate level may not provide optimal distinctiveness or sufficient interpersonal attachment to other consumers. This provides self-concept benefits that nourish and operate in complement with the superordinate identification. The extent that different in-group identities influence behaviour relates to their importance in a consumer's self-concept and relevance to context. We provide implications for theory and practice.},

abstract = {Understanding what influences an individual to transition from awareness that a sport team exists to attraction to that team is of critical importance in the management and development of consumer bases. Determining the factors that prevent individuals at a stage of awareness from becoming attracted is of equal importance. In this paper we use a social identity approach to explore reasons for non-attendance. Qualitative data were gathered from a mixed-method online survey administered to registered participants in a large football (soccer) association in New South Wales. The questionnaire included an open-ended question allowing individuals who had not attended a match during the previous 12 months to elaborate on the reasons that they did not attend. The seventy-five individuals who responded to this open-ended question comprise the sample for this research. Data highlighted that cognitive apathy and disidentification were both salient cognitive responses associated with individuals who did not attend. Furthermore, club values and characteristics were shown to influence team-based perceptions. The findings present implications for sport teams to overcome cognitive apathy and disidentification through organisation-initiated efforts to disseminate information and promote the team, as well as efforts to align team characteristics and values with consumer perceptions. ?? 2011 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

abstract = {The propensity of strongly identified fans to contribute positive organizational outcomes for sport teams underpins why team identification maintains a central position in sport management. In the current study we examine the multidimensional structure, stability, and interrelationships between the dimensions of team identification, using longitudinal data (April 2011-April 2012) collected from fans of a new Australian Rules football team (N = 602). A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the team identification items included (measured using the Team*ID scale), supported a five-dimensional model structure. This model was subsequently computed as a longitudinal CFA to test the configural and metric invariance of the Team*ID scale. We used a cross-lagged panel model to examine the longitudinal stability of, and interrelationships between, the dimensions: affect, behavioral involvement, cognitive awareness, private evaluation, and public evaluation. Each dimension displayed relative stability over time. In addition, public evaluation and private evaluation in April 2011 displayed a positive relationship with behavioral involvement in April 2012. Similarly, cognitive awareness in April 2011 predicted increases in public evaluation in April 2012. We conclude with implications for theory and practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Throughout our evolutionary history, our cognitive systems have been altered by the advent of technological inventions such as primitive tools, spoken language, writing, and arithmetic systems. Thirty years ago, the Internet surfaced as the latest technological invention poised to deeply reshape human cognition. With its multifaceted affordances, the Internet environment has profoundly transformed our thoughts and behaviors. Growing up with Internet technologies, “Digital Natives” gravitate toward “shallow” information processing behaviors characterized by rapid attention shifting and reduced deliberations. They engage in increased multitasking behaviors that are linked to increased distractibility and poor executive control abilities. Digital natives also exhibit higher prevalence of Internet-related addictive behaviors that reflect altered reward-processing and self-control mechanisms. Recent neuroimaging investigations have suggested associations between these Internet-related cognitive impacts and structural changes in the brain. Against mounting apprehension over the Internet's consequences on our cognitive systems, several researchers have lamented that these concerns were often exaggerated beyond existing scientific evidence. In the present review, we aim to provide an objective overview of the Internet's impacts on our cognitive systems. We critically discuss current empirical evidence about how the Internet environment has altered the cognitive behaviors and structures involved in information processing, executive control, and reward-processing.},

abstract = {Hermeneutics is the exploration of the process of textual interpretation. As such, it has long been recognised as an important component within the humanities and social sciences, whether one deals with actual texts or with other the products of meaningful human activity, including social actions and utterances. Here, we offer a brief overview of the contribution that hermeneutics might make to the philosophy of sport. If sports and sporting events are seen to be the results of meaningful human interactions, then they are meaningful phenomena that lend themselves to interpretation. It can thus be argued that a hermeneutics of sport is a valid and important discipline, worthy of consideration and development. We offer a review of the nature and history of hermeneutics in general, briefly exploring the place of key figures such as Schleiermacher, Heidegger, Gadamer and Riceour, as well as key concepts such as that of the hermeneutic circle. In addition, we suggest the importance of a hermeneutics of suspicion, grounded in the work of Marx, Freud and Nietzsche. In the second part of our introduction, we briefly comment on each of the papers that comprise the current volume, and that reflect the diversity of approaches that a hermeneutics of sport might embrace.},

This paper attempts to answer this question using data from the 2014 men's basketball tournament and more than 400 predictions of game outcomes submitted to a contest hosted by the website Kaggle. We begin by describing how we built a prediction model for men's basketball tournament outcomes under the binomial log-likelihood loss function. Next, under different sets of true underlying game probabilities, we simulate tournament outcomes and imputed pool standings, in an effort to determine how much of an entry's success can be attributed to luck. While one of our two submissions finished first in the Kaggle contest, we estimate that this winning entry had no more than about a 12{\%} chance of doing so, even under the most optimistic of game probability scenarios.},

However, most of this work has concentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport comparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one sport to another. In this manuscript, we use betting market data to develop a Bayesian state-space model that can be uniformly applied across sporting leagues to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes. Our model can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the between-season, within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths, as well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade of play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB), finding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the largest home advantage. Additionally, the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative randomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing a new metric for judging league competitiveness that works in absence of factors outside of team control.},

abstract = {Purpose: This article (1) analyzes and synthesizes literatures from philosophy and education to propose a conceptual framework for caring in schools and caring school leadership and (2) reports the results of an exploratory analysis of the relationship of caring principal leadership to school-level supports for student academic learning. Conceptual Framework: This conceptual framework defines caring as a quality of social relationships with several core elements: attentiveness and authentic knowledge of others, motivational displacement, situationality, mutuality, and authenticity. Characteristics of relationships and organizational conditions that enable caring and caring leadership are proposed. Research Design: The empirical analysis employs a survey of teachers in 134 schools. Measures of principal caring and student academic support were developed and related to the conceptual framework and student achievement using regression and path analyses. Findings: We found significant positive relationships among caring principal leadership, student academic support, and teachers' sense of collective responsibility. In addition, small but significant relationships of caring principal leadership with student academic support and teachers' collective responsibility to student achievement were apparent. Caring leadership has an indirect relationship to student achievement through student academic support. Conclusions: This article makes a case for the importance of caring and caring school leadership for the success and well-being of both teachers and students in schools. While the work is exploratory, it points in promising directions for further theory building, research, and development of leadership practice.},

abstract = {People are optimistic about their prospects relative to others. However, existing studies can be difficult to interpret because outcomes are not zero-sum. For example, one person avoiding cancer does not necessitate that another person develops cancer. Ideally, optimism bias would be evaluated within a closed formal system to establish with certainty the extent of the bias and the associated environmental factors, such that optimism bias is demonstrated when a population is internally inconsistent. Accordingly, we asked NFL fans to predict how many games teams they liked and disliked would win in the 2015 season. Fans, like ESPN reporters assigned to cover a team, were overly optimistic about their team's prospects. The opposite pattern was found for teams that fans disliked. Optimism may flourish because year-to-year team results are marked by auto-correlation and regression to the group mean (i.e., good teams stay good, but bad teams improve). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Recently, philosophers and social scientists have turned their attention to the epistemological shifts provoked in established sciences by their incorporation of big data techniques. There has been less focus on the forms of epistemology proper to the investigation of algorithms themselves, understood as scientific objects in their own right. This article, based upon 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork with Russian data scientists, addresses this lack through an investigation of the specific forms of epistemic attention paid to algorithms by data scientists. On the one hand, algorithms are unlike other mathematical objects in that they are not subject to disputation through deductive proof. On the other hand, unlike concrete things in the world such as particles or organisms, algorithms cannot be installed as the objects of experimental systems directly. They can only be evaluated in their functioning as components of extended computational assemblages; on their own, they are inert. As a consequence, the epistemological coding proper to this evaluation does not turn on truth and falsehood but rather on the efficiency of a given algorithmic assemblage. This article suggests that understanding the forms of algorithmic rationality employed in such inquiry is crucial for charting the place of data science within the contemporary academy and knowledge economy more generally.},

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

@article{Mahony2000,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a psychological commitment to team (PCT) scale to be used in segmenting sport consumers based on loyalty. Previous research on the loyalty construct suggested the importance of using both behavioral and attitudinal measures when attempting to assess the loyalty of consumers (Backman {\&} Crompton, 1991a; Day, 1969). Although measures of behavioral loyalty are readily available in team sports (e.g., attendance, television viewing), no appropriate measure of attitudinal loyalty was available prior to the current study. A number of statistical procedures and four separate data collections were used to assess the strength of the PCT scale. The PCT scale provides sport marketers with a reliable and valid measurement tool for differentiating consumers into discrete segments based on the strength of their overall loyalty. Alternative strategies for strengthening fan allegiance for each of the different loyalty segments are provided. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

While providing an extended historical account focused on the contributions to hermeneutics by Schleier- macher, Dilthey, Heidegger and Gadamer, Palmer also aims to give a more inclusive and systematic discussion of the nature of the theory of interpretation itself. In part I of the book, he deals with problems concerning the definition, scope and significance of hermeneutics. In part II, he treats the above mentioned thinkers and contrasts their respective theoretical foundations for hermeneutics. In the last part of the book, he gathers some of the different insights developed along the way into a "manifesto" of thirty theses designed to help solve a "crisis" of literary criticism in America.},

abstract = {Creating emotional brand attachment is a key branding issue in today's marketing world. One way to accomplish this is to match the brand's personality with the consumer's self. A key question, however, is whether the brand's personality should match the consumer's actual self or the consumer's ideal self. On the basis of two empirical studies of 167 brands (evaluated by 1329 and 980 consumers), the authors show that the implications of self- congruence for consumers' emotional brand attachment are complex and differ by consumers' product involvement, consumers' individual difference variables, and the type of self-congruence (fit of the brand's personality with the consumer's actual self versus with the consumer's ideal self). On a general level, actual self-congruence has the greatest impact on emotional brand attachment. Product involvement, self-esteem, and public self-consciousness increase the positive impact of actual self-congruence but decrease the impact of ideal self-congruence on emotional brand attachment. The authors discuss important managerial and academic implications of these findings.},

abstract = {This paper treats the problem of modeling and forecasting the outcomes of NBA basketball games. First, it is shown how the benchmark model in the literature can be extended to allow for heteroscedasticity and estimation and testing in this framework is treated. Second, time-variation is introduced into the model by introducing a dynamic state space model for team strengths. The in-sample results based on eight seasons of NBA data provide weak evidence for heteroscedasticity, which can lead to notable differences in estimated win probabilities. However, persistent time variation is only found when combining the data of several seasons, but not when looking at individual seasons. The models are used for forecasting a large number of regular season and playoff games and the common finding in the literature that it is difficult to outperform the betting market is confirmed. Nevertheless, a forecast combination of model based forecasts with betting odds can lead to some slight improvements.},

@article{Marshall2001,
abstract = {There is now a well-established critique of technically-led knowledge management practices in which knowledge is treated in passive, objectivised, and static terms. A key element of this critique concerns the limits of codification strategies directed at making tacit knowledge explicit. This is founded upon an interpretative conceptualization of inter-subjective understanding as always provisional, incomplete, and embedded in contexts of social action. This paper argues that there is more to considering knowledge practices than the problem of understanding. Shared understanding, where participants to an interaction achieve a satisfactory interpretation of their respective positions, in no way implies mutual agreement about the validity of these positions. Drawing on insights from Habermas about models of social action and knowledge-guiding interests, a series of concepts encouraging sensitivity to the relationship between knowledge, power, and interests is presented. Aspects of the argument are then illustrated with case examples drawn from research into organizational knowledge in companies producing and using complex products and systems.},

Recent efforts by anthropologists to dislodge the traditional notion of culture as a homogenous, stable whole have opened up a variety of ways of imagining culture that place power differentials, flux, and contradiction at its center. Including attention to a wide variety of social domains outside the laboratory, attending to the ways nonscientists actively engage with scientific knowledge, and focusing on the complex interactions that flow both into and out of research laboratories are ways the activities of both scientists and nonscientists can be situated in the heterogeneous matrtx of culture.

By collecting, analysing and visualising digital traces (i.e. posts, tweets, comments), a " issue map " can be created in order to make visible and understandable the network of the actors involved and their position in any public debate. Drawing on experiences gathered during a European project, we identified a two-phases-approach for the creation of issue maps. In the two phases-exploration and communication-visualisations play a key role, with two different connotations: in the first, they act as analytical devices used by researchers. In the second, they become communicative artefacts for a larger public. In this paper, we describe how we defined this approach, outlining the theoretical background and its connections with communication design. We highlight the main criticalities found in designing the issue maps before finally presenting our results.},

To categorize the plays algorithmically, I describe the requirements a suitable dynamic language must have to be both more concise and more precise than standard X's and O's chalk diagrams. The language specifies for each player their initial starting spots, trajectories, and timing, with iteration as needed. A key component is acceleration. To determine optimal starting spots, I compute burst locations on the court where players tend to accelerate or decelerate more than usual. Cluster analysis on those burst points compared to all points reveals a difference in which areas of the court see more intense action. The primary burst clusters appear to be the paint, the top of the key, and the extended elbow and wing area. I document the most frequently accelerating players, positions, and teams, as well as the likelihoods of acceleration and co-acceleration during a set play and other components intended to collectively lead to an algorithmic taxonomy.},

Backtested over ten years, the automated GM outperforms every single team, and by substantial margins. From draft decisions alone, the average team lost about {\$}130,000,000 worth of on-court productivity relative to what they could have had with the automated GM; this shortfall represents about a quarter of the average franchise value. Historically the automated GM's choices would have produced about twice as much as the human choices actually did: approximately one extra win per year per draft pick. The system is calibrated using an innovative extension of traditional machine learning methods, applied to a uniquely broad historical database incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, in a way that avoids survivorship bias, and for a variety of performance metrics; it is thus robust, comprehensive, realistic, and does not overfit information from the future.

Part of a larger, multimethod comparative case study, it investigates the attitudes of bloggers of a niche and nonniche sport toward the output of mainstream media. While these bloggers differed in terms of output and motivations, the questionnaire found they shared similar attitudes to mainstream sports media (MSSM) and the role of blogging as distinct styles of sports communication. The findings suggest that blogging can be seen as a way for fans to react to and critique the work of the mainstream media in communicating sports. It could also be well as a means to supplementing and augmenting the work of MSSM in ways that reflect the nature and the media discourses surrounding their particular sport. Finding that social elements were also a fundamental pleasure and motivation, further research into the particularities of social experience is indicated. },

abstract = {In Merton's early work in the sociology of science three theses are identified: (1) economic and military influence in shaping early modern science; (2) the' 'Puritan spur" to scientific activity; (3) the critical role of a democratic social order for the support of science. These themes are located in the contemporary economic crisis of the 1930s, the rise of Nazism and fascism, and the emerging radical and Marxist political activism of scientists in the United States and the United Kingdom. Mer- ton's interaction with this context is critical for understanding his choice of problems and issues for the nascent sociology of science. The enunciation of the four-part normative structure of science is closely identified with the political ideals of this context. Merton's transition from an interest in problems of science in society to his postwar concern with the social and organizational structures of science and the social behavior of scientists is framed against the anticommunist and anti-Marxist thrust of immediate postwar politics in the United States. The implications of this change for the paradigms of the sociology of science are noted. Robert},

Design/methodology/approach – A content analysis was used to examine online comments posted by all 30 teams in the NBA on Facebook and Twitter during the off-season. Findings – The results demonstrate that NBA teams have embraced social media, primarily using four different types of communication to engage fans: Informing, Marketing, Personalizing and Activating.

abstract = {Despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamics within professional sports games, relative little is known about what patterns or principles, if any, cut across different sports. Using a comprehensive data set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and professional (American) football, professional hockey, and professional basketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Across these sports, scoring tempo - when scoring events occur - closely follows a common Poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. Similarly, scoring balance - how often a team wins an event - follows a common Bernoulli process, with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combining these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they both reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game outcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest specific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports dynamics.},

abstract = {One challenge many team's in many diDerent leagues face is the ability to recognize fan motives and fan aGendance to their team's games (Ouray 2006). Team owners struggle every year to Fnd the best balance between winning games, winning championships, training players and hiring coach's all on the base of making money. Teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) earn money through T.V contracts, licensed goods, and Ticket sales. Many diDerent owners in diDerent leagues have their own approaches and goals when the thought of raising attendance at games comes to the question. Mike Ilitch Sr., owner of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Detroit Red Wings and Major League Baseball's (MLB) Detroit Tigers have approached revenue generation through building a team to win a championship with the idea that winning league championships results in increased ticket sales and aGendance (Shea 2007). In soccer this trend of building a team to win a championship can be seen with the arrival of Freddy Adu (DeSchriver 2007) and David Beckham. Ee study done on David Beckham supports my research question looking at when joining the MLS. Since Beckham's star power was already established the research found that bringing Beckham to the Galaxy increased its aGendance because of his popularity and star power (Lawson, Sheehan, {\&} Stephenson 2008). By using the information about Beckham and L.A. Galaxy of importing star power players to the MLS we should look at other leagues to see if similar results appear in other leagues like the NBA.},

We show that at the heart of each of these paths to fandom are the close ties that the women formed in their social networks – either as children through their kin, or later in life through others that entered their networks. Women become fans, we argue, because of the strong social ties that they have with people who are existing fans.},

Prior knowledge can improve machine learning models by indicating relevant variables and parameter values. Yet, this prior knowledge is often tacit and only available from domain experts. We present a novel approach that uses interactive visualization to elicit the tacit prior knowledge and uses it to improve the accuracy of prediction models. The main component of our approach is a user model that models the domain expert's knowledge of the relevance of different features for a prediction task. In particular, based on the expert's earlier input, the user model guides the selection of the features on which to elicit user's knowledge next. The results of a controlled user study show that the user model significantly improves prior knowledge elicitation and prediction accuracy, when predicting the relative citation counts of scientific documents in a specific domain.},

Typically, NBA players are discussed and compared in an heuristic, imprecise manner that relies on unmeasured intuitions about player behavior. This makes it difficult to draw comparisons between players and make accurate player specific predictions. Modeling shot attempt data as a point process, we create a low dimensional representation of offensive player types in the NBA. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, we show that a low-rank spatial decomposition summarizes the shooting habits of NBA players. The spatial representations discovered by the algorithm correspond to intuitive descriptions of NBA player types, and can be used to model other spatial effects, such as shooting accuracy.},

abstract = {First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

We find that local and out-of-market fans differ in their total purchase amounts, with out-of-market fans spending more than local consumers on average, and differential spending effects based on the home team win probability. In particular, this differential behavior has important implications for Rottenberg's Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis. We find evidence that interest in visiting team quality dominates interest in perceived contest uncertainty, fitting the reference dependent preference model in the context of low local team quality. Further, these findings also have important implications related to market segmentation and dynamic ticket pricing in professional sport.},

This thesis will explore the interaction of two primary methods of evaluating basketball—“advanced analytics” and “traditional evaluation methods”—that must be integrated together to reduce risk in decision-making and achieve competitive advantage. “Advanced analytics” does not have a precise definition, but can broadly be defined in this thesis as “insights gained from quantitative data analysis about basket in this thesis as “insights gained from quantitative data analysis about basketball.” “Traditional evaluation methods” include any form of observation, such as on-site scouting, live coaching, and game film analysis. Through an interview and survey protocol, this thesis explores methods for quantifying human intangibles, the role of “gut instinct,” NBA organizational structures, as well as the specific strategies and tools in place for key decision-makers to balance all available information. The findings of this thesis are that NBA organizations should formalize their decision- making processes with repeatable strategies and specific tools that align with the strategic plan and vision of the organization, in order to maximize team performance and pursue NBA championships.},

To test the extent to which NBA careers can be predicted by variables that represent past performance and variables that might represent untapped potential. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN$\backslash$nArchival data was collected from measures taken at the pre-draft NBA combine and publicly available data on college and NBA performance. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD$\backslash$nThe first three years of players' NBA careers from 2001 to 2006 draft classes were analyzed using a growth mixture model with collected variables predicting latent class. The estimated parameters were then used to forecast the 2007 to 2010 draft classes. Draft order was also predicted with the same variables. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nNBA player skill formed 3 latent classes of players; only one class performed well in the NBA. Membership in the strongest class was only predicted by age, quality of college program, and players' college performance. Latent class probabilities predicted NBA career trajectory slightly better than draft order in both the estimation model and in the forecast model. NBA draft order was predicted by the same variables as well as arm span and agility. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS$\backslash$nNone of the variables analyzed supported an “untapped potential” hypothesis. There is clear evidence for roles of training environment and the stability of skill. The data is consistent with views of deliberate practice and skill acquisition and appears to be consistent with data showing the benefits of being identified as talented, such as the Matthew effect.},

We use changes in topic shares to predict conflict one and two years before it occurs. In our predictions we distinguish between predicting the likelihood of conflict across countries and the timing of conflict within each country. Most factors identified by the literature, though performing well at predicting the location of conflict, add little to the prediction of timing. We show that news topics indeed can predict the timing of conflict onset. We also use the estimated topic shares to document how reporting changes before conflict breaks out.},

abstract = {Advances in computing technology have been instrumental in creating an assortment of powerful information visualization techniques. However, the selection of a suitable and effective visualization technique for a specific dataset and a data mining task is not trivial. This work automatically selects an appropriate visualization technique based on the given metadata and the task that a user intends to perform. The appropriate visualization is predicted based on an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model which classifies the input data into one of the eight predefined classes. A purpose built dataset extracted from the existing knowledge in the discipline is utilized to train the neural network. The dataset covers eight visualization techniques, including: histogram, line chart, pie chart, scatter plot, parallel coordinates, map, treemap, and linked graph. Various architectures using different numbers of hidden units, hidden layers, and input and output data formats have been evaluated to find the optimal neural network architecture. The performance of neural networks is measured using: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the classification. Optimal neural network architecture is determined by convergence time and number of iterations. The results obtained from the best ANN architecture are compared with five other classifiers, k-nearest neighbor, na??ve Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine. The proposed system outperforms four classifiers in terms of accuracy and all five classifiers based on execution time. The trained neural network is also tested on twenty real-world benchmark datasets, where the proposed approach also provides two alternate visualizations, in addition to the most suitable one, for a particular dataset. A qualitative comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches is also presented. The results show that the proposed technique assists in selecting an appropriate visualization technique for a given dataset with high accuracy.},

abstract = {The integration of social media technologies with second screen devices during the broadcasts of in-real-life events facilitates a mode of online conversation we refer to as the social soundtrack. In this research, we compute the correlations between the comments people post in the social soundtrack on various platforms (i.e., Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr) and the terms people search for on a major web search engine (i.e., Google). The broadcast media event for this research is Super Bowl 2015 commercials. Using statistical t-tests, we compare the correlations between the relative volume of searching, obtained via Google Trends, and the relative volume of social soundtrack postings on each of three social media platforms for two temporal phases (Pre and Post) for Super Bowl 2015. We exclude the game day from our research due to insufficiency of granularity for search data on the game day. Research results show that there is no overall significant difference in phase correlation between social media and search data. However, at the individual level, there are brands that do show significant correlation between phases. The number of significant positive correlations between the social soundtrack postings and web search concerning brands are considerably high compared to the number of significant negative correlations in both phases. The research results are important in identifying the temporal trends and interplay between type of social media platforms and searching concerning the sharing of brand mentions in word-of-mouth marketing. The result will eventually help retailers focusing on the brands with higher correlations to lever the opportunity of electronic word of mouth advertising.},

@article{Murthy2015,
abstract = {The use of social media by collaborative organizations has been studied in a variety of contexts, including virtual teams, enterprise organizations, and social movements. However, social media are not often examined within the context of scientific organizations. This article explores how an organization of 122 life scientists and science-related professionals—anonymized as Science City Network (SciCity)— combine monthly symposia with social media, including Twitter, Facebook, and blogs. Using an online survey, we found that younger SciCity members are more interested in using social media to support a collaborative community, whereas older members are more interested in social applications. Social media use was not found to significantly differ by gender. Using social network analysis, we found several individuals who act as hubs of information who keep the SciCity Twitter network alive. However, the hierarchical structure of the network reveals that it is better suited for information dissemination than innovation and collaboration. Our examination of this scientific organization ultimately offers insight into how a coalition of multiple social media technologies is used differentially by organizational members and that there is ultimately no general consensus of the utility of social media to scientific collaboration. This finding tempers some claims of the utility of social media for scientific collaboration. The use of social media by collaborative organizations has been studied in a variety of contexts, including virtual teams (Muller et al., 2012; Murthy, Rodriguez, {\&} Lewis, 2013), enterprise organizations (Brzozowski, 2009), and social movements (Juris, 2012). The notion that social media can foster trust and other preconditions for mean-ingful collaboration in organizations makes intuitive sense as these technologies have the potential to increase interactions between organizational members and ultimately build social capital. Though social capital has been successfully used to study social movements within virtual communities (Cogburn {\&} Espinoza-Vasquez, 2011), a key distinction of social capital online versus offline is that when it is acquired online, it can lack an affect-based dimension. Erving Goffman's (1967) studies of gestures and communication argue that this affect is part of the richness of face-to-face interactions. However, others have argued that social-media-driven technologies can successfully (albeit, sometimes minimally) encourage the affective dimensions that foster the accu-mulation of social capital (Valenzuela, Park, {\&} Kee, 2009). Emergent social media have forced us to expand our understanding of not only the types of social capital that the Internet can foster (Sander, 2005), but also the speed of social capital acquisition and new ways of using it. A particularly interesting case is that of hybrid organizations that combine meaningful aspects of online and offline social capital, potentially making them fruitful spaces for collaboration. Meetup.com, a virtual community that comes together face-to-face via offline meetings, termed " meetups, " is a well-known example. Sander (2005) argues that these organizational hybrids can foster " alloy social capital, " a strong form of social capital that leverages its ability to use the extensibility of the Internet and the low-friction context for inter-action as well as stronger affect-based ties constructed through offline contact. This follows Jurgenson's (2012) argument that social media can " augment " offline interac-tions and should not be thought of as oppositional to face-to-face interactions. This article explores one such hybrid community, anonymized as Science City Network (SciCity), a life science organization that combines regularly scheduled events with social-media-based interactions. SciCity consists of two intersecting operational modes: regularly scheduled meetings and an accompanying Twitter stream. In all, 122 people have attended SciCity events that generate significant Twitter activity during these organized face-to-face events. A recent event generated more than 4,000 tweets. SciCity's monthly meetings cycle through diverse themes in the sciences ranging from topical areas to science policy issues. Twitter feeds using the {\#}SciCity hashtag support the conversation and experience high traffic during monthly events and low traffic oth-erwise. SciCity's virtual participants include geographically remote members who use the video streaming service Livestream to view the event and simultaneously use the Twitter hashtag to interact with the group as a whole regardless of physical attendance. Tweets are projected behind the conference speaker to unify the conversation. Our case study is based around a survey administered during the summer of 2012. Survey questions gathered data regarding demographics, social media usage and per-ception, and the SciCity Twitter network. We were interested in explaining how Twitter use complemented (or not) one's offline interactions with SciCity as well as under-standing the nature of interpersonal relationships between SciCity Twitter users.

abstract = {$\backslash$nThis paper examines the relationships between product and corporate brands with a view to clarifying the role and function of corporate branding in the context of different brand architectures. Through the prism of rebranding decisions, brand architecture is analysed as an evolutionary strategy decision. Two broad strategies are identified: an integration strategy which seeks to achieve image alignment between corporate and product brands; and a separation strategy which seeks to shape different images for different stakeholders. Implementing these strategies within the context of the brand architecture, we introduce the concept of `ascending and descending brand extension', which leverages the strong image of the corporate brand to enhance the image and credibility of the product brand and vice versa. Based on this analysis, we propose three types of corporate branding strategy within the brand architecture framework: the `trade name', which is a basic identity over a house of brands; the `business brand', which is consciously nurtured and is aimed primarily at stakeholders other than consumers; and, finally, the `holistic corporate brand' is a fully developed corporate brand, extending across all target audiences.$\backslash$n},

This paper focuses on the information overload problem. Operators often do not have adequate access to information that may be relevant in the decision-making process. In many CC centers, information is stored without filtering or refinement for later use, and its visualization is pre-defined at design time, offering no possibility of customization. To address the problems created by this lack of support, we propose an architecture to enable fast and easy selection from multiple information sources, and definition of appropriate visualizations. Following this architecture, we developed the “Emergency Dashboard”, a system that provides selection of a desired set of data and presents it, using configurable dashboards. We also provide collaborative mechanisms, given that, at times, it is not possible for a single user to handle such large datasets alone.},

The Sovereign Nation of Baseball provided the groundwork for this series by discussing how federal courts have historically deferred to those who have traditionally run Major League Baseball (the office of the Commissioner of Baseball as well as the cabal of club owners), bending the rules that would otherwise dictate the resolution of legal issues in their continuing effort to protect and promote “America's Game.” Truly Sovereign At Last brings this analysis up to the present day and peeks into the future by discussing how changes within the governing structure of the Major League game, as well as larger societal shifts beginning in the 1960's, have perhaps altered the nature of the federal judiciary's traditional deference. In this vein, the Eighth Circuit's 2007 C.B.C. Distribution v. MLB AM ruling may prove to be a bellwether decision in that the court both stuck with tradition and departed from it all at once. On the one hand, the court's ruling was, in many ways, consistent with prior decisions in that it, not unlike many courts since the Supreme Court created baseball's antitrust exemption in 1921, suspended the normal rules of law (in this instance, MLB AM's acknowledged rights of publicity) that otherwise would have dictated the outcome of a case and held instead that baseball's elevated status necessitated a different result in the interest of protecting this national asset. On the other, however, the C.B.C. decision marked a departure from tradition because here, although the court took pains to ensure that its ruling protected the concept of baseball (i.e., the idea of baseball as emblematic of idyllic American values), the ruling nevertheless was one that held against the traditional guardians and spokesmen of the concept of baseball -- Major League Baseball. Although historically, the concept of baseball and Major League Baseball were intertwined to the point where a ruling for the Commissioner and owners was necessarily perceived as a ruling that protected the larger concept of baseball as well, the C.B.C. court held differently, separating the concept of baseball from its Major League incarnation. In so doing, the court, perhaps unwittingly, made a bold statement: that the interests of Major League Baseball may not inevitably be consistent with the more expansive public interest in our national pastime. This was a statement that its judicial forbears most likely would have been loath to make. This article examines the factors that appear to have severed the concept of baseball from its putative Major League protectors. The decline in national status of the club owners, from an era where they were household names to the current one where they are virtually anonymous, is discussed to show how the new breed of owners (products of the corporate revolution of the 1960's) who replaced the well-known and respected manor lords were individually stronger than their predecessors but nevertheless less able to speak forcefully on behalf of the game due to their collective anonymity and increasingly disparate interests. In addition, the emergence of the Players Association throughout the 1970's, ‘80's and ‘90's is analyzed in order to show how this effectively marginalized the owners (along with the office of the Commissioner) as well. Moreover despite their newfound prominence, this article shows how the newly empowered players were nevertheless unable to become the commanding voice of the concept of baseball due to growing national distrust of their Players Association as well as its executive director, Marvin Miller, which were both depicted by both the owners and public alike as self-interested and greedy. As such, just like the new age owners, the players likewise have become an increasingly unlikely source to which a court could now comfortably defer in the interest of promoting the concept of baseball. In all, this article discusses how the public's (judges and others) overall perception of the concept of baseball has changed over time, from one where great faith was placed in those who ran the professional game to one where mistrust in Major League Baseball's leadership structure is engendered more often than not. As a result, and as the C.B.C. decision illustrates, judicially protecting and promoting the concept of baseball is perhaps no longer as easy as simply deferring to those in control of the game at the Major League level. As this article concludes, in the C.B.C. decision, we may have been provided a glimpse of the future with regard to the interaction between baseball and the law: the concept of baseball may be protected just as it always has been but the courts may be less likely to look to Major League Baseball for guidance on how to best achieve this goal.},

abstract = {While most of the voter turnout literature focuses on the differences between voters and nonvoters, scant attention has been paid to what separates regular voters from the “irregular voters” who move in and out of the electorate. This article shows that citizens who regularly vote will be more knowledgeable and involved in the political system than voters who turnout irregularly. In addition, the article supports the existing claim that it is easier for voters to understand social policies than economic policies. These two principles lead to the hypothesis that economic and social policy preferences will predict the decisions of regular voters while the decisions of irregular voters will be predicted by social policy preferences but not economic preferences. American National Election Studies data from 1988-2008 provides support for these hypotheses. Though poor economic conditions may bring irregular voters out to the polls, their ballots are cast for candidates with similar social policy preferences, not necessarily similar economic stances.},

abstract = {The visualization of the simulation results must be done in conformity with beneficiaries perception and professional domain understanding. It means that right data must be identified before. Semantic technologies provide new ways for accessing data and acquiring knowledge. The underlying structures allow finding information easier, gathering meanings and associations of the data entities and associating the data to users' knowledge. Even though the focus of the research in this area is more to provide "machine readable" data, human-centered systems benefit from the technologies too. Especially graphical representations of the semantically structured data play a key-role in today's research. The meaningful relations of data entities and the meaningful and labeled clustering of data in form of semantic concepts enable new ways to visualize data. With these new ways, various challenges are related with deploying semantics visualizations beyond analytical search and simulation. The goal is to give a common understanding of the term semantics as it is used in semantic web. This paper dealt with the general idea of semantics visualization. First a short introduction to semantic formalisms is given followed by a general definition. Subsequently approaches and techniques of existing semantics visualizations are presented, where-as a new classification is introduced to describe the techniques. The article concludes with future challenges in semantics visualization focusing on users, data and tasks.},

abstract = {Sensemaking is described as the process of comprehension, finding meaning and gaining insight from information, producing new knowledge and informing further action. Understanding the sensemaking process allows building effective visual analytics tools to make sense of large and complex datasets. Currently, it is often a manual and time-consuming undertaking to comprehend this: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. In this paper, we propose a general approach to facilitate such a qualitative analysis process, and introduce a prototype, SensePath, to demonstrate the application of this approach with a focus on browser-based online sensemaking. The approach is based on a study of a number of qualitative research sessions including observations of users performing sensemaking tasks and post hoc analyses to uncover their sensemaking processes. Based on the study results and a follow-up participatory design session with HCI researchers, we decided to focus on the transcription and coding stages of thematic analysis. SensePath automatically captures user's sensemaking actions, i.e., analytic provenance, and provides multi-linked views to support their further analysis. A number of other requirements elicited from the design session are also implemented in SensePath, such as easy integration with existing qualitative analysis workflow and non-intrusive for participants. The tool was used by an experienced HCI researcher to analyze two sensemaking sessions. The researcher found the tool intuitive and considerably reduced analysis time, allowing better understanding of the sensemaking process.},

abstract = {Communication is an important part of scientific practice and, arguably, may be seen as constitutive to scientific knowledge. Yet, often scientific communication gets cursory treatment in science studies as well as in science education. In Nature of Science (NOS), for example, communication is rarely mentioned explicitly, even though, as will be argued in this paper, scientific communication could be treated as a central component of NOS. Like other forms of communication, scientific communication is socially and symbolically differentiated. Among other things, it encompasses technical language and grammar, lab communications, and peer reviews, all of which will be treated in this paper in an attempt to engage on an empirical and theoretical level with science as communication. Seeing science as a form of communicative action supplements the epistemological view of science that is standard to both NOS and the philosophy of science. Additions to the seven NOS aspects on Lederman's (Handbook of research on science education. Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, pp. 831–879, 2007 ) list are put forward as well as preliminary thoughts on the inclusion of scientific communication into NOS instruction.},

@article{Nissen2016,
abstract = {In the process of scientific inquiry, certain claims accumulate enough support to be established as facts. Unfortunately, not every claim accorded the status of fact turns out to be true. In this paper, we model the dynamic process by which claims are canonized as fact through repeated experimental confirmation. The community's confidence in a claim constitutes a Markov process: each successive published result shifts the degree of belief, until sufficient evidence accumulates to accept the claim as fact or to reject it as false. In our model, publication bias --- in which positive results are published preferentially over negative ones --- influences the distribution of published results. We find that when readers do not know the degree of publication bias and thus cannot condition on it, false claims often can be canonized as facts. Unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are published, the scientific process will do a poor job at discriminating false from true claims. This problem is exacerbated when scientists engage in p-hacking, data dredging, and other behaviors that increase the rate at which false positives are published. If negative results become easier to publish as a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims can be more readily distinguished. To the degree that the model accurately represents current scholarly practice, there will be serious concern about the validity of purported facts in some areas of scientific research.},

We conclude that the major challenges presented by DesignX problems stem not from trying to understand or address the issues, but rather arise during implementation, when political, economic, cultural, organizational, and structural problems overwhelm all else. We suggest that designers cannot stop at the design stage: they must play an active role in implementation, and develop solutions through small, incremental steps—minimizing budgets and the resources required for each step— to reduce political, social, and cultural disruptions. This approach requires tolerance for existing constraints and trade-offs, and a modularity that allows for measures that do not compromise the whole. These designs satisfice rather than optimize and are related to the technique of making progress by “muddling through,” a form of incrementalism championed by Lindblom.},

abstract = {Decision support techniques and models for marketing decisions are critical to retail success. Among different marketing domains, customer segmentation or profiling is recognized as an important area in research and industry practice. Various data mining techniques can be useful for efficient customer segmentation and targeted marketing. One such technique is the RFM method. Recency, frequency, and monetary methods provide a simple means to categorize retail customers. We identify two sets of data involving catalog sales and donor contributions. Variants of RFM-based predictive models are constructed and compared to classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification. Classical data mining algorithms were found to yield better prediction, as expected, in terms of both prediction accuracy and cumulative gains. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are presented. Finally we discuss practical implications based on the empirical results. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A modern web page is often served by running layout code on data, producing an HTML document that enhances the data with front/back matters and layout/style operations. In this paper, we consider the opposite task: separating a given web page into a data component and a layout program. This separation has various important applications: page encoding may be significantly more compact (reducing web traffic), data representation is normalized across web designs (facilitating wrapping, retrieval and extraction), and repetitions are diminished (expediting updates and redesign). We present a framework for defining the separation task, and de- vise an algorithm for synthesizing layout code from a web page while distilling its data in a lossless manner. The main idea is to synthesize layout code hierarchically for parts of the page, and use a combined program-data representation cost to decide whether to align intermediate programs. When intermediate programs are aligned, they are transformed into a single program, possibly with loops and conditionals. At the same time, differences between the aligned programs are captured by the data component such that ex- ecuting the layout code on the data results in the original page. We have implemented our approach and conducted a thorough experimental study of its effectiveness. Our experiments show that our approach features state of the art (and higher) performance in both size compression and record extraction. 1},

Also, implementation architectures of the use cases have been published. However, conceptual work integrating the approaches into one coherent reference architecture has been limited. The contribution of this paper is technology independent reference architecture for big data systems, which is based on analysis of published implementation architectures of big data use cases. An additional contribution is classification of related implementation technologies and products/services, which is based on analysis of the published use cases and survey of related work. The reference architecture and associated classification are aimed for facilitating architecture design and selection of technologies or commercial solutions, when constructing big data systems.},

Analyzing past data it is possible to extract important information on the sport and infer better strategies for the future. This paper introduces an ongoing work, which aims at providing data visualizations to make it easier and faster to extract useful information from a NBA dataset. By adapting known data visualization methods to this context, one can visualize large amounts of data simultaneously and rapidly extract the relevant information. Moreover, the project was developed as a website and it is possible to add new information to the dataset with no need of regenerating or recompiling the visualization code.},

abstract = {When powerful people cause harm, they often do so indirectly through other people. Are harmful actions carried out through others evaluated less negatively than harmful actions carried out directly? Four experiments examine the moral psychology of indirect agency. Experiments 1A, 1B, and 1C reveal effects of indirect agency under conditions favoring intuitive judgment, but not reflective judgment, using a joint/separate evaluation paradigm. Experiment 2A demonstrates that effects of indirect agency cannot be fully explained by perceived lack of foreknowledge or control on the part of the primary agent. Experiment 2B indicates that reflective moral judgment is sensitive to indirect agency, but only to the extent that indirectness signals reduced foreknowledge and/or control. Experiment 3 indicates that effects of indirect agency result from a failure to automatically consider the potentially dubious motives of agents who cause harm indirectly. Experiment 4 demonstrates an effect of indirect agency on purchase intentions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The process of developing the technical artifact—that is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable—is much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this paper I argue that it's critical to teach analysts how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that their analysis is reproducible, accurate, and collaborative. A critical component of this is adopting a blameless postmortem culture. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, as well as a blameless way of correcting course as analysts encounter errors, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible.},

@article{Pathak2015,
abstract = {In this paper we dissect four different data types that can create forecasts for the results of the Oscars: fundamentals, polling, prediction markets, and experts. We start by creating the most accurate forecasts possible for each data type. We then compare and contrast how these different data types and their forecasts compete over four attributes: relevancy, accuracy, timeliness, and cost effectiveness. We argue that forecasts created with fundamental data are expensive to construct and show only limited adjustments over time, which constrains how accurate and timely the forecasts can be; the academic literature should not ignore cost-effectiveness in that it is critical to the practical application of the forecast research. However, fundamental data does provide valuable insights into the relationship between key indicators for nominated movies and outcomes; most of the power comes from the results in other awards shows, popular ratings are more important than critical ratings, and box office performance has little predictive power. Polling has the potential to create both accurate and timely forecasts, but it requires incentives for frequent responses by high-information users to stay timely, and proper transformation of raw polls into forecasts to be accurate. Third, prices in prediction markets are highly accurate forecasts, but can further benefit by a simple transformation, yielding the most accurate method in our comparison. Finally, experts create something similar to fundamental models, but are generally not comparatively accurate or timely. Overall, prediction markets lead our comparison across all attributes, but polling shows promise; we believe that the results of this study generalize to many domains.},

Moreover, a negative effect was detected and explained rather controversially: It is argued that the majority of spectators prefer to see the home team play either a much inferior team or a rather successful team. With data of n = 306 matches in the German Bundesliga, a generalized Tobit estimator with individual cut-off points and error terms clustered by home teams is employed to follow up with the discussion on the (un)importance of outcome uncertainty. The results highlight a significant positive effect on attendance when either the home and/or the away team still has a theoretical chance to win the championship while the suggested importance of teams still having the possibility to qualify for the UEFA Champions League is not supported (medium-term uncertainty). Furthermore, in line with previous research we could detect a negative effect of short-term uncertainty. However, while there is no evidence that spectators prefer the home team to play an inferior team, the results suggest that it is rather a strong brand of the away team that rises attendance figures in the German Bundesliga.},

abstract = {The sports industry is viewed as being of growing economic significance, reflected in its promotion in public policy. One specific aspect of this policy is to argue that investment in international sporting success creates pride from sporting success, which contributes to subjective well-being (SWB). However, though it has been argued that indicators of sporting success, such as the number of medals won at major sports events like the Olympics, act as a proxy for pride from sporting success, there have not been any direct tests of this hypothesis. Controlling for the impact of physical activity, attendance at sports events and other standard covariates, this paper addresses this hypothesis by focusing on a variable which directly measures pride felt from sporting success (Pride) by individuals. Because of the possibility that a latent characteristic such as nationalism, or overall national pride, might be linked to both Pride and SWB, i.e. an endogeneity problem is present, an instrumental variable technique is employed. The findings do not support the hypothesis that pride following from sporting success can contribute distinctly to SWB. Moreover, the hosting of events may be more important than success at them, a point suggested by the positive association between attendance at sporting events and SWB. As such the goals of public sector investment in both hosting major sports events as well as investment in sports development to achieve international sporting success are shown to be more distinct than implied in much of the policy announcements and require more careful scrutiny. {\textcopyright} 2013 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

@article{Payzan-Lenestour2011,
abstract = {Recently, evidence has emerged that humans approach learning using Bayesian updating rather than (model-free) reinforcement algorithms in a six-arm restless bandit problem. Here, we investigate what this implies for human appreciation of uncertainty. In our task, a Bayesian learner distinguishes three equally salient levels of uncertainty. First, the Bayesian perceives irreducible uncertainty or risk: even knowing the payoff probabilities of a given arm, the outcome remains uncertain. Second, there is (parameter) estimation uncertainty or ambiguity: payoff probabilities are unknown and need to be estimated. Third, the outcome probabilities of the arms change: the sudden jumps are referred to as unexpected uncertainty. We document how the three levels of uncertainty evolved during the course of our experiment and how it affected the learning rate. We then zoom in on estimation uncertainty, which has been suggested to be a driving force in exploration, in spite of evidence of widespread aversion to ambiguity. Our data corroborate the latter. We discuss neural evidence that foreshadowed the ability of humans to distinguish between the three levels of uncertainty. Finally, we investigate the boundaries of human capacity to implement Bayesian learning. We repeat the experiment with different instructions, reflecting varying levels of structural uncertainty. Under this fourth notion of uncertainty, choices were no better explained by Bayesian updating than by (model-free) reinforcement learning. Exit questionnaires revealed that participants remained unaware of the presence of unexpected uncertainty and failed to acquire the right model with which to implement Bayesian updating.},

abstract = {Keeping students back in the same grade – retention – has always been a controversial issue in Education, with some defending it as a beneficial remedial practice and others arguing against its detrimental effects. This paper undertakes an analysis of this issue, focusing on the differences in student motivation and self-related variables according to their retention related status, and the interrelationship between retention and these variables. The participants were 695 students selected from two cohorts (5th and 7th graders) of a larger group of students followed over a 3-year project. The students were assigned to four groups according to their retention-related status over time: (1) students with past and recent retention; (2) students with past but no recent retention; (3) students with no past but recent retention; (4) students with no past or recent retention. Measures of achievement goal orientations, self-concept, self-esteem, importance given to school subjects and Grade Point Average (GPA) were collected for all students. Repeated measures MANCOVA analyses were carried out showing group differences in self- esteem, academic self-concept, importance attributed to academic competencies, task and avoidance orientation and academic achievement. To attain a deeper understanding of these results and to identify profiles across variables, a cluster analysis based on achievement goals was conducted and four clusters were identified. Students who were retained at the end of the school year are mainly represented in clusters with less adaptive motivational profiles and almost absent from clusters exhibiting more adaptive ones. Findings highlight that retention leaves a significant mark that remains even when students recover academic achievement and retention is in the distant past. This is reflected in the low academic self-concept as well as in the devaluation of academic competencies and in the avoidance orientation which, taken together, can undermine students' academic adjustment and turn retention into a risk factor.},

abstract = {Which team is the best in the league? How does my team fare with respect to the rest of the league? These are questions that every sports fan is interested in knowing the answers to. In other cases, such as in college sports, knowing the answer to these questions is crucial for shaping the picture of spe-cific contests. In professional sports, sports networks provide power rankings regularly -typically every week or month de-pending on the season length of the league -based on their experts opinion. In this work we propose an alternative, ob-jective and network-based way of ranking sports teams. In brief, our method is based on analyzing a directed network formed between the teams of the corresponding leagues that captures their win-lose relationships. Using data from the National Football League and the National Basketball As-sociation, we show that even simple network theory metrics (e.g., Page Rank) can provide a ranking that has the same ac-curacy in predicting winners of upcoming match-ups as more complicated systems (e.g., Cortana). We further explore the impact of the network structure on the prediction accuracy and we show that the cycles in the network are significantly correlated with the performance. We finally propose an ad-vanced ranking technique based on tensor decomposition.},

Linear and logarithmic utility functions appear not as expressions for the value of money but as mappings that result in ergodic observables for purely additive and purely multiplicative dynamics, the most natural stochastic processes to model wealth. This perspective is at odds with the boundedness requirement for utility functions in the dominant formalism of decision theory. We highlight conceptual and mathematical inconsistencies throughout the development of decision theory, whose correction clarifies that the modern perspective is legitimate and that boundedness of utility functions is not required.},

At this intersection lies a process of communication in which interested actors present particular understandings of the world in the hope of creating or sustaining preferred patterns of social relations. In this process, groups and individuals struggle to create and disseminate cultural forms that support preferred patterns of power and dominance. Critical hermeneutics is a methodology which is useful in analyzing these attempts. To underscore the usefulness of the approach, the method is applied to a corporation's image advertising campaign. Critical hermeneutics provides a framework for the inclusion of several formal methods of analyzing organizations texts.

However, many choices are made in the presence of other choosers who may seize the better option while one is still engaged in search. How long do (and should) people search before choosing between uncertain options in the presence of such competition? To address this question, we introduce a new experimental paradigm called the competitive sampling game. We use both simulation and empirical data to compare search and choice between competitive and solitary environments. Simulation results show that minimal search is adaptive when one expects competitors to choose quickly or is uncertain about how long competitors will search. Descriptively, we observe that competition drastically reduces information search prior to choice. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {But there is one term the indiscriminate use of which, I believe, has done infinite harm, the word 'fetish'. The story of its origin and introduction into West Africa is so well known that I need not here repeat it. R. 5. Rattray, Ashanti (1923) (tout objet historique est f?tiche) Maurice Merleau-Ponty, working note to Le Visible et l'invisible (7964) "Fetish" has always been a word of sinister pedigree. Discursively promiscuous and theoretically suggestive, it has always been a word with a past, forever becoming "an embarrassment"1 to disciplines in the human sciences that seek to contain and control its sense. Yet anthropologists of primitive religion, sociologists of political economy, psychiatrists of sexual deviance, and philosophers of modernist aesthetics have never ceased using the term, even as they testify to its conceptual doubtfulness and referential uncertainty. It seems this word's usage is always somewhat "indiscriminate," always threatening to slide, as in Merleau-Ponty's tentative proposition, into an impossibly general theory. Yet it is precisely in the surprising history of this word as a comprehensive theoretical term indispensable to such crucial thinkers as Comte, Marx, and Freud that the real interdisciplinary interest of "fetish" lies. This essay is intended to provide the introductory discussion to an extensive exploration of this history, an exploration that must begin with a study of the origin of the fetish as a word and as a historically significant object. My thesis is that the fetish, as an idea and a problem, and as a novel object not proper to any prior discrete society, originated in the cross-cultural spaces of the coast of West Africa during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Of course, origins are never absolute. While I argue that the fetish originated within a novel social formation during this period through the development of the pidgin word Fetisso, this word in turn has a linguistic and accompanying conceptual lineage that may be traced. Fetisso derives from the Portuguese word feiti?o, which in the late Middle Ages meant "magical practice" or "witchcraft" performed, often innocently, by the simple, ignorant classes.2 Feiti?o in turn derives from the Latin adjective facticius, which originally meant "manufactured." The historical study of the fetish must begin by considering these words in some detail, only then going on to examine the initial application of feiti?o on the African coast, its subsequent development into Fetisso, and finally that word's textual dissemination into the languages of northern Europe, where national versions of the word developed during the seventeenth century. The study of the origin of the fetish concludes at the beginning of the eighteenth century with the text of Willem Bosman, for his Accurate Description of the Coast of Guinea provided the image and conception of fetishes on which Enlightenment intellectuals based their elaboration of the notion into a general theory of primitive religion.3 The elaboration of this general Enlightenment theory, as developed from Bayle to de Brosses and then adopted by philosophers of the late eighteenth century, constitutes a second period of the history of the fetish. Its dissemination into a host of popular and social scientific discourses in the nineteenth century marks a third large period, and one could view twentieth-century theoretical discourses that seek to make a unity out of the diversity of earlier fetish discourses as the last historical development of this idea. The essentially theoretical nature of the interest in the history of the term, as well as the need for an initial schematism to establish criteria of relevance for the subsequent historical discussion, call for a preliminary consideration of the nature of the problem named by the word "fetish." The problem of the fetish In taking a historical approach that stresses the importance of the word itself, I am opposing both universalist and particularist arguments that dismiss the fetish as a proper object with its own singular},

Currently, these professional analysts use R, Stata, SAS, and other statistical software packages for uncovering insights from game data. Quantitative sports consultants seek a competitive advantage both for their clients and for themselves as analytics becomes increasingly valued by teams, clubs, and squads. In order for the information visualization community to support the members of this blossoming industry, it must recognize where and how visualization can enhance the existing analytical workflow. In this paper, we identify three primary stages of today's sports analyst's routine where visualization can be beneficially integrated: 1) exploring a dataspace; 2) sharing hypotheses with internal colleagues; and 3) communicating findings to stakeholders.Working closely with professional ice hockey analysts, we designed and built SnapShot, a system to integrate visualization into the hockey intelligence gathering process. SnapShot employs a variety of information visualization techniques to display shot data, yet given the importance of a specific hockey statistic, shot length, we introduce a technique, the radial heat map. Through a user study, we received encouraging feedback from several professional analysts, both independent consultants and professional team personnel.},

abstract = {Consumer goods can have significance beyond their utilitarian and commercial value (McCracken 1986)," and can become a vehicle of transcendent experience (Belk, Wallendorf, and Sherry 1989). Intense experiences with brands can lead to consumer loyalty--sometimes extreme levels of loyalty. Consumer Devotion In some cases, consumer connections with brands reach a level of loyalty so intense that it survives poor product performance, scandal, bad publicity, high prices, and absence of promotional efforts. It is loyalty that motivates consumers to buy T-shirts, baseball caps, and bumper stickers in order to display the brand name and trademark. The term "consumer devotion" implies religious fervor and it includes elements of sacredness (Belk, Wallendorf, and Sherry 1989). Fans of college football teams provide a convenient context for discussion of this fervor. Fandom--Previous research has created a typology of sports fans (Hunt, Bristol, and Bashaw 1999). Additional research has observed extreme fandom in non-sports contexts, such as exhibited by Star Trek fans (Kozinets 2001). Commitment--In our study, we are concerned with three types of commitment: calculative normative, and affective (Echambadi 2000). Model Our model of consumer devotion is presented in Figure 1. It includes antecedents that lead to calculative or normative commitment. Some consumers experience a sacralization process to make the transition from there to affective commitment which then leads to specific outcomes. Antecedents--College football fans experience various antecedents to committing to teams such as responding to family norms to support a specific team, seeking to fill voids created by something lacking in their lives, enjoying association with other fans, and fulfilling a need to belong. Others become fans of teams that are less popular in order to express distinction from others. Commitment--Calculative and Normative--Fans whose commitment is calculative are loyal to the team for extrinsic benefits, such as enjoying a winning season or watching an exciting star player. They are characterized by more devoted fans as being "fair-weather fans." Normatively committed fans support the team through a sense of obligation. Sacralization--Sacralization processes (Belk, Wallendorf, and Sherry 1989) serve as a transition to move fans to a stronger form of commitment. These processes include quintessence, inheritance, external sanction, collecting, gift giving, pilgrimage, and ritual. Commitment--Affective--After fans move through the sacralization process, their commitment to the team has been internalized, and has become more affective in nature (Allen, Machleit, and Kleine 1991). The team becomes more emotionally significant and is used by the fans to maintain their self-concept (Ball and Tasaki 1992). Outcomes--We identified several outcomes from affective commitment. Affectively committed fans ascribe positive attributes to their own team and negative attributes to rivals. They are loyal to their teams despite losing seasons, but they feel the losses intensely and personally. They reflect the sacralization process that brought them to affective commitment by expressing their commitment with religious references. Desacralization--Affective commitment is more enduring than calculative or normative commitment, but it is not necessarily permanent. It is possible for a team to lose its sacred status with fans. Proactive Sustaining Behaviors--Desacralization does not occur for fans who engage in various behaviors that help to keep the team sacred. If fans participate in these behaviors of their own volition, then they must remain loyal to the team to assure cognitive consistency. These behaviors include regular participation in rituals, displaying symbols of the team through clothing and memorabilia, and the building and maintaining of "shrines" in their homes. Some fans assume a missionary role, actively seeking to convert new fans. Many make significant personal sacrifices to support the teams and watch the games. Model Extension We investigated the generalization of the model, developed in a football context, to traditional "product" brands. Antecedents--We found many of the same antecedents for devotion to product brands as we did for football teams. Some consumers mentioned wearing Nikes to fit in with the group; others avoided the brand in order to express distinction. Consumers expressed self-images through their preferred brands of soft drinks and jeans. Commitment--Calculative and Normative--Calculatively committed consumers expressed preferences for brands due to product features and benefits. Normatively committed customers referred to family traditions with various brands. Sacralization--Informants reported many of the same processes for other types of brands as with the sacralization processes for football team commitment. As an example, one informant described collecting Coca-Cola memorabilia. Commitment--Affective--As with football fans, informants in the extension study reported sharing values with the brand and feeling an attachment to it. Outcomes--Several outcomes were similar to those found for football fans, including commitment to the brand through bad times, and in-group/out-group behaviors. Desacralization--Brands lose their sacred status through public relations failures and poor product performance. Proactive Sustaining Behaviors--Rituals, recruiting, and sacrifices were observed for consumer brands just as they were for football teams. These similarities suggest generalizability of the model. It is significant, however that not all the outcomes and sustaining rituals were as consistent as they were with the football fans. Pilgrimages and religious references were far less common. Conclusion Brand managers should look to football teams and strong entertainment brands such as Star Trek (Kozinets 2001) rather than to other branded products to learn about consumer devotion. For managers, the sacralization process and the proactive sustaining behaviors of the model are particularly important. If they can provide quintessence, or other sacralization processes, they may be able to encourage movement to affective commitment. If they can also encourage proactive sustaining behaviors, they can enjoy the benefits of highly loyal, devoted customers. Limitations and Future Directions Our model was developed conceptually. It would be helpful to test the model with qualitative and quantitative empirical data and in different contexts.},

These insights were verified in subsequent simulations, including an attractor network that accounted for latency data directly in its time to settle on a response. Further analyses of the ability of networks to reproduce data on acquired surface dyslexia support a view of the reading system that incorporates a graded division of labor between semantic and phonological processes, and contrasts in important ways with the standard dual-route account.},

Although numerous examples of using social media platforms for marketing purposes exist, and despite the various efforts from the companies and the general popularity of the medium, measuring the effectiveness is elusive. An approach towards overcoming these challenges is examination of the activities undertaken by the companies and the consumers' responses to them in the form of measurements and use of analysis tools. To contribute in this direction, we propose an evaluation framework that allows companies to perform social media analytics through continuous monitoring of the content and activities on their social media marketing channels, and to measure the effectiveness of social media utilization for marketing purposes. We describe the specific methods and illustrate the application of the proposed approach using a Facebook brand page case study. Finally, we discuss the benefits it brings to the companies.},

The study examined the differences in high school dropout and graduation rates between CIS and its comparison schools over a 4-year period, starting from the year prior to CIS implementation to 3 years after implementation. Our analyses showed that CIS high schools made stronger gains in on-time graduation rates, and had greater reductions in dropout rates, than comparison schools over the same period. Results were considerably stronger for CIS schools that implemented the CIS model with a high degree of fidelity. (Contains 8 tables, 2 figures, and 2 footnotes.)},

abstract = {Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose Casual Information Visualization (or Casual Infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization [32], social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information [41]. We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield},

abstract = {Trivia is any fact about an entity, which is interesting due to any of the following characteristics - unusualness, uniqueness, unexpectedness or weirdness. Such interesting facts are provided in 'Did You Know?' section at many places. Although trivia are facts of little importance to be known, but we have presented their usage in user engagement purpose. Such fun facts generally spark intrigue and draws user to engage more with the entity, thereby promoting repeated engagement. The thesis has cited some case studies, which show the significant impact of using trivia for increasing user engagement or for wide publicity of the product/service. 

In this thesis, we propose a novel approach for mining entity trivia from their Wikipedia pages. Given an entity, our system extracts relevant sentences from its Wikipedia page and produces a list of sentences ranked based on their interestingness as trivia. At the heart of our system lies an interestingness ranker which learns the notion of interestingness, through a rich set of domain-independent linguistic and entity based features. Our ranking model is trained by leveraging existing user-generated trivia data available on the Web instead of creating new labeled data for movie domain. For other domains like sports, celebrities, countries etc. labeled data would have to be created as described in thesis. We evaluated our system on movies domain and celebrity domain, and observed that the system performs significantly better than the defined baselines. A thorough qualitative analysis of the results revealed that our engineered rich set of features indeed help in surfacing interesting trivia in the top ranks.},

Malpas' topological approach is presented here as an exploration of the character and structure of human placedness or situatedness. This inquiry into situatedness is argued to be integral of any attempt to lay bare the topological character of understanding and interpretation, and therefore of any project aiming at developing a topological hermeneutics. The chapter offers, firstly, a general outline of Malpas' topology as a philosophical method that is most characteristic of his sustained commitment to explore topos and the belonging together of time and place (along with space) as proper to human involvement in world. Secondly, the chapter moves on to explore certain core spatial and topological concepts in order to explain what is at issue in Malpas' topological elaboration of hermeneutics and how this essential connection between place and hermeneutics is construed by him. Finally, the chapter takes up explicitly the question of place and attempts to clarify in what sense Malpas' treatment of this notion might be said to be distinctive in relation to other contemporary developments.},

Structured Abstract Purpose This paper studies the relationship between network ties (NT) and transactive memory systems (TMS), observed through three dimensions—specialization (TMSS), credibility (TMSCR), and coordination (TMSCO)—in the presence of leadership (LDR) as a moderating variable, in university research-and-development (R{\&}D) groups. Design/methodology/approach The data are composed of 257 university R{\&}D groups. To confirm the hypotheses, we use multiple linear regression analysis with a moderating effect. Findings The conclusions show that the relationships between NT and two of the three dimensions of TMS (TMSCR and TMSCO) are significant when LDR is included as a moderating variable. Although the effect of TMSS is positive, it is not significant. Including the interaction element enables better explanation of two of the dimensions of TMS in the sector analyzed. Thus, LDR is perfectly applicable to the university R{\&}D environment. Research limitations/implications This research has several limitations that suggest further possibilities for empirical research. The limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the research and the judgment of a single manager as the basis of the perception analyzed for each group. Practical implications We provide several implications for R{\&}D practitioners. The results of this study could be validated in other universities in other geographic areas, enabling better generalization and applicability of the results. The results described may serve as a guide for group leaders of university R{\&}D. This research helps us to see the importance of leadership in forming internal research networks that help researchers to perform common projects in order to obtain better results in the group. Thus, the groups provided better results to society. Originality/value No studies have tested the moderating effect of LDR in university R{\&}D empirically. Our results provide information to fill this gap and demonstrate the applicability of leadership as a key element in the organization, improvement, and cohesion of R{\&}D groups.},

In my thesis, I first review other quantitative models of the NBA. Second, I present novel features extracted from NBA play-by-play data that I use in building my predictive models. Third, I propose predictive models that use team-level statistics. In the team models, I show that team strength relations might not be transitive in these models. Fourth, I propose predictive models that use player-level statistics. In these player-level models, I demonstrate that taking the context of a play into account is important in making useful prediction. Finally, I analyze the effectiveness of the different models I created, and propose suggestions for future lines of inquiry.},

abstract = {The evaluation of exploratory search relies on the ongoing paradigm shift from focusing on the search algorithm to focusing on the interactive process. This paper proposes a model-driven formative evaluation approach, in which the goal is not the evaluation of a specific system, per se, but the exploration of new design possibilities. This paper gives an example of this approach where a model of sensemaking was used to inform the evaluation of a basic exploratory search system(s) in the context of a sensemaking task. The model suggested that, rather than just looking at simple search performance measures, we should examine closely the interwoven, interactive processes of both representation construction and information seeking. Participants were asked to make sense of an unfamiliar topic using an augmented query-based search system. The processes of representation construction and information seeking were captured and analyzed using data from experiment notes, interviews, and a system log. The data analysis revealed users' sources of ideas for structuring representations and a tightly coupled relationship between search and representation construction in their exploratory searches. For example, users strategically used search to find useful structure ideas instead of just accumulating information facts. Implications for improving current search systems and designing new systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Visualizations often appear in multiples, either in a single display (e.g., small multiples, dashboard) or across time or space (e.g., slideshow, set of dashboards). However, existing visualization design guidelines typically focus on single rather than multiple views. Solely following these guidelines can lead to effective yet inconsistent views (e.g., the same field has different axes domains across charts), making interpretation slow and error-prone. Moreover, little is known how consistency balances with other design considerations, making it difficult to incorporate consistency mechanisms in visualization authoring software. We present a wizard-of-oz study in which we observed how Tableau users achieve and sacrifice consistency in an exploration-to-presentation visualization design scenario. We extend (from our prior work) a set of encoding-specific constraints defining consistency across multiple views. Using the constraints as a checklist in our study, we observed cases where participants spontaneously maintained consistent encodings and warned cases where consistency was overlooked. In response to the warnings, participants either revised views for consistency or stated why they thought consistency should be overwritten. We categorize participants{\&}{\#}x0027; actions and responses as constraint validations and exceptions, depicting the relative importance of consistency and other design considerations under various circumstances (e.g., data cardinality, available encoding resources, chart layout). We discuss automatic consistency checking as a constraint-satisfaction problem and provide design implications for communicating inconsistencies to users.},

abstract = {The advisability of a particular strategy must be judged not only in terms of the situation on the bases and the number of men out, but also with regard to the inning and the score. Two sets of data taken from a large number of major league games are used to give (1) the dependence of the probability of winning the game on the score and inning, and (2) the distribution of runs scored between the arrival of a new batter at the plate in each of twenty-four situations and the end of the half-inning. The first shows that the runs adding most to the probability of winning are the one tying the score and the one putting the batting team one ahead. All other runs are slightly less valuable early in the game, and become increasingly less valuable as the game proceeds. By combining the two sets of data, the situations are determined in which an intentional base on balls, a double play allowing a run to score, a sacrifice, and an attempted steal are advisable strategies, if average players are concerned. An index of batting effectiveness based on the contribution to run production in average situations is developed.},

abstract = {What is distinctive about a bringing a . learning perspective to moral psychology? Part of the answer lies in the remarkable transformations that have taken place in learning theory over the past two decades, which have revealed how powerful experience-based learning can be in the acquisition of abstract causal and evaluative representations, including generative . models capable of attuning perception, cognition, affect, and action to the physical and social environment. When conjoined with developments in neuroscience, these advances in learning theory permit a rethinking of fundamental questions about the acquisition of moral understanding and its role in the guidance of behavior. For example, recent research indicates that spatial learning and navigation involve the formation of non-perspectival as well as ego-centric models of the physical environment, and that spatial representations are combined with learned information about risk and reward to guide choice and potentiate further learning. Research on infants provides evidence that they form non-perspectival expected-value representations of agents and actions as well, which help them to navigate the human environment. Such representations can be formed by highly-general mental processes such as causal and empathic simulation, and thus afford a foundation for spontaneous moral learning and action that requires no innate moral faculty and can exhibit substantial autonomy with respect to community norms. If moral learning is indeed integral with the acquisition and updating of casual and evaluative models, this affords a new way of understanding well-known but seemingly puzzling patterns in intuitive moral judgment-including the notorious trolley problems.},

abstract = {Empirical evaluation methods for visualizations have traditionally focused on assessing the outcome of the visual analytic process as opposed to characterizing how that process unfolds. There are only a handful of methods that can be used to systematically study how people use visualizations, making it difficult for researchers to capture and characterize the subtlety of cognitive and interaction behaviors users exhibit during visual analysis. To validate and improve visualization design, it is important for researchers to be able to assess and understand how users interact with visualization systems under realistic scenarios. This article presents a methodology for modeling and evaluating the behavior of users in exploratory visual analysis. We model visual exploration using a Markov chain process comprising transitions between mental, interaction, and computational states. These states and the transitions between them can be deduced from a variety of sources, including verbal transcripts, videos and audio recordings, and log files. This model enables the evaluator to characterize the cognitive and computational processes that are essential to insight acquisition in exploratory visual analysis and reconstruct the dynamics of interaction between the user and the visualization system. We illustrate this model with two exemplar user studies, and demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative analytical tools it affords.},

The underpinnings of this social identity approach are outlined, and four key lessons for sport that are indicative of the analytical and practical power of the approach are presented. These suggest that social identity is the basis for sports group (1) behavior, (2) formation and development, (3) support and stress appraisal, and (4) leadership. Building on recent developments within sport science, we outline an agenda for future research by identifying a range of topics to which the social identity approach could fruitfully contribute.

Using this design space, we designed and developed ChartAccent, a tool that allows people to quickly and easily augment charts via a palette of annotation interactions that generate manual and data-driven annotations.

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models re- main mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation tech- nique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an in- terpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative indi- vidual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization prob- lem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted. 1.},

abstract = {Knight-knave brain teasers are about a realm in which some people, knights, tell only truths, whereas all others, knaves, tell only lies. For example, suppose person A says, “I am a knight and B is a knight,” and person B says, “A is a knave.” Is A a knight or a knave? Is B a knight or a knave? In a pilot study, we asked subjects to think aloud while solving problems like these. Their statements suggested that they were making assumptions about the knightlknave status of the characters and drawing deductive inferences from these assumptions to test their consistency. This encouraged us to model the process by means of a simulation based on an earlier natural-deduction theory of reasoning. The model contains a set of deduction rules in the form of productions and a working memory that holds a proof of the correst answer. The greater the number of steps (assumptions and inferences) in the proof the greater the predicted difficulty of the puzzle. The experiments reported here confirmed this prediction by showing that subjects were more likely to make mistakes (Experiment 1) and take longer to solve (Experiment 2) puzzles as- sociated with a larger number of proof steps},

This paper investigates the oft-overlooked requirement of attractiveness (or aesthetics) in visualization, and, in doing so, discusses a wider role for the design process which emphasizes the benefits of disseminating design rationale. In presenting a model of three potential roles for design in information visualization, we suggest that the field would benefit from encompassing a broader scope that includes visualizations produced as part of commercial practice or artistic exploration. We conclude with a discussion on the practical consequences to the academic community of adopting our model consequences that will require a paradigm shift in the way we value, teach and conduct information visualization research.},

abstract = {Tournament design is of crucial importance in competitive sports. The primary goal of effective tournament design is to provide incentives for the participants to maximize their performance both during the tournament and in the time period leading up to the tournament. In spectator sports, a secondary goal of tournament design is to also promote interesting match ups that generate fan interest. Seeded tournaments, in general, promote both goals. Teams or individuals with strong performances leading up to a tournament receive higher seeds which increase their chances of progressing further in the tournament. Furthermore, seeding ensures that the strongest teams or players are most likely to meet in the final rounds of the tournament when fan interest is at its peak. Under some distributions of team or player skill, however, a seeding system can introduce anomalies that could affect incentives. Our analysis of the NCAA men's basketball tournament uncovers such an anomaly. The seeding system in this tournament gives teams with better success in the regular season more favorable first round match ups, but the tournament is not reseeded as the games progress. Therefore, while higher seeds progress to the 2 nd round of the tournament at uniformly higher rates than lower seeds, this relationship breaks down in later rounds. We find that 10 th and 11 th seeds average more wins and typically progress farther in the tournament than 8 th and 9 th seeds. This finding violates the intended incentive structure of seeded tournaments.},

Using secondary administrative data from a state department of education and a state department of juvenile justice, two models are examined in the current study. Utilizing hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression models, the relative impacts of demographic characteristics (race, gender, birth year), school-related factors (grade failure, free lunch status, average number of days missed per year, expulsions) and juvenile justice involvement were examined on graduation and dropout outcomes. Across models, juvenile justice contact and school expulsion were the best predictors of negative school outcomes; The findings also demonstrate that race was not as predictive of dropout as were other factors. Findings suggest that interventions, practices, and policies in schools that may prevent negative behavior and subsequent consequences (expulsion and/or juvenile justice contact) may impact the more distal outcomes of high school graduation and dropout.},

abstract = {Science and Technology Studies (STS) names a heterogeneous body of research, scholars, journals, professional associations, and academic programs that focus on the history, social organization and culture of science and technology. Begun in the 1960s in response to the recognizable growth in science in the contemporary world and to the educational and economic policy implications of this explosion of scientific research and development, STS also responded to issues of public responsibility that seemed to be engendered by technological innovation. In the 1960s, the Vietnam War encouraged scientists to become politically active; in 1975, the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA set a precedent in which scientists regulated the own community, established formal norms, and supported legally enforceable guidelines for research; and in the early 1980s, public recognition of the AIDS epidemic sparked rumors of the viruses' origin in laboratory mishaps. The burgeoning synergy of attention and concern in the late 20th century produced, by the 21st century, a continuous concatenation between science and public policy concerns. By the time STS first emerged as an interdisciplinary conversation, significant accounts of the work of scientists, the production of scientific knowledge, and the impact of technological innovation had been produced in each of the social sciences from their distinctive disciplinary perspectives. Across the diverse research traditions, however, there seemed to be a shared or received view of science as the work of great minds, usually male, discovering nature's hidden patterns and mechanisms. If the 'focused confluence" of research begged for integration (Edge 1995:3-24), STS scholarship not only integrated the existing scholarship but revised these conventional accounts of science. Early Sources The earliest roots of STS can be traced to the sociology of knowledge and the philosophy of science, representing opposing positions on the possibilities of transcendent, universal knowledge of nature. The theoretical materials of STS developed from debates between those seeking to establish secure empirical methods for understanding nature and the sociologists who insisted that our access to nature, as well as other minds, was inevitably 1},

abstract = {A geographically-resolved, multi-level Bayesian model is used to analyze the data presented in the U.S. Police-Shooting Database (USPSD) in order to investigate the extent of racial bias in the shooting of American civilians by police officers in recent years. In contrast to previous work that relied on the FBI's Supplemental Homicide Reports that were constructed from self-reported cases of police-involved homicide, this data set is less likely to be biased by police reporting practices. County-specific relative risk outcomes of being shot by police are estimated as a function of the interaction of: 1) whether suspects/civilians were armed or unarmed, and 2) the race/ethnicity of the suspects/civilians. The results provide evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the probability of being {\{}black, unarmed, and shot by police{\}} is about 3.49 times the probability of being {\{}white, unarmed, and shot by police{\}} on average. Furthermore, the results of multi-level modeling show that there exists significant heterogeneity across counties in the extent of racial bias in police shootings, with some counties showing relative risk ratios of 20 to 1 or more. Finally, analysis of police shooting data as a function of county-level predictors suggests that racial bias in police shootings is most likely to emerge in police departments in larger metropolitan counties with low median incomes and a sizable portion of black residents, especially when there is high financial inequality in that county. There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.},

abstract = {Proposals to establish a 'science of interaction' have been forwarded from Information Visualization and Visual Analytics, as well as Cartography, Geovisualization, and GIScience. This paper reports on two studies to contribute to this call for an interaction science, with the goal of developing a functional taxonomy of interaction primitives for map-based visualization. A semi-structured interview study first was conducted with 21 expert interactive map users to understand the way in which map-based visualizations currently are employed. The interviews were transcribed and coded to identify statements representative of either the task the user wished to accomplish (i.e., objective primitives) or the interactive functionality included in the visualization to achieve this task (i.e., operator primitives). A card sorting study then was conducted with 15 expert interactive map designers to organize these example statements into logical structures based on their experience translating client requests into interaction designs. Example statements were supplemented with primitive definitions in the literature and were separated into two sorting exercises: objectives and operators. The objective sort suggested five objectives that increase in cognitive sophistication (identify, compare, rank, associate, {\&} delineate), but exhibited a large amount of variation across participants due to consideration of broader user goals (procure, predict, {\&} prescribe) and interaction operands (space-alone, attributes-in-space, {\&} space-in-time; elementary {\&} general). The operator sort suggested five enabling operators (import, export, save, edit, {\&} annotate) and twelve work operators (reexpress, arrange, sequence, resymbolize, overlay, pan, zoom, reproject, search, filter, retrieve, {\&} calculate). This taxonomy offers an empirically-derived and ecologically-valid structure to inform future research and design on interaction.},

A small-scale structural model reveals that this is because we are polling from a broader information set, and voters respond as if they had polled twenty of their friends. This model also provides a rational interpretation for why respondents' forecasts are correlated with their expectations. We also show that we can use expectations polls to extract accurate election forecasts even from extremely skewed samples.},

As opposed to a textual description, our morphing explains an unfamiliar visualization through purely visual means. We demonstrate our idea by ways of four visualization pair examples: data table and parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix and hyperbox, linear chart and spiral chart, and hierarchical pie chart and treemap. The analogy is commutative i.e. any member of the pair can be the unfamiliar visualization. A series of studies showed that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. The participants could understand the unfamiliar visualization methods in all of the four pairs either fully or at least significantly better after they observed or interacted with the transitions from the familiar counterpart. The four examples suggest how helpful visualization pairings be identified and they will hopefully inspire other visualization morphings and associated transition strategies to be identified.},

abstract = {In political campaigning substantial resources are spent on voter mobilization, that is, on identifying and influencing as many people as possible to vote. Campaigns use statistical tools for deciding whom to target ("microtargeting"). In this paper we describe a nonpartisan campaign that aims at increasing overall turnout using the example of the 2004 US presidential election. Based on a real data set of 19,634 eligible voters from Ohio, we introduce a modern statistical framework well suited for carrying out the main tasks of voter targeting in a single sweep: predicting an individual's turnout (or support) likelihood for a particular cause, party or candidate as well as data-driven voter segmentation. Our framework, which we refer to as LORET (for LOgistic REgression Trees), contains standard methods such as logistic regression and classification trees as special cases and allows for a synthesis of both techniques. For our case study, we explore various LORET models with different regressors in the logistic model components and different partitioning variables in the tree components; we analyze them in terms of their predictive accuracy and compare the effect of using the full set of available variables against using only a limited amount of information. We find that augmenting a standard set of variables (such as age and voting history) with additional predictor variables (such as the household composition in terms of party affiliation) clearly improves predictive accuracy. We also find that LORET models based on tree induction beat the unpartitioned models. Furthermore, we illustrate how voter segmentation arises from our framework and discuss the resulting profiles from a targeting point of view.},

abstract = {The media narrative of the 'contract year effect' is espoused across all major professional American sports leagues, particularly the MLB and NBA. In line with basic incentive theory, this hypothesis has been shown to be true in baseball, but the analysis in basketball to this point has been flawed. In estimating the contract year effect in the NBA, this paper is the first to define rigorously the various states of contract incentives, the ignorance of which has been a source of bias in the literature thus far. It further expands on previous analyses by measuring individual performance more broadly across a range of advanced metrics. Lastly, it attempts to account for the intrinsic endogeneity of playing in a contract year, as better players get longer contracts and are thus NBA contract structure to form an instrument, and by comparing performance to a priori expectations. In this manner, this paper produces the first rigorous finding of a positive contract year phenomenon. The estimated effect is about half that found in baseball, equivalent to a 3-5 percentile boost in performance for the median player in the NBA.},

abstract = {Visual analytics enables us to analyze huge information spaces in order to support complex decision making and data exploration. Humans play a central role in generating knowledge from the snippets of evidence emerging from visual data analysis. Although prior research provides frameworks that generalize this process, their scope is often narrowly focused so they do not encompass different perspectives at different levels. This paper proposes a knowledge generation model for visual analytics that ties together these diverse frameworks, yet retains previously developed models (e.g., KDD process) to describe individual segments of the overall visual analytic processes. To test its utility, a real world visual analytics system is compared against the model, demonstrating that the knowledge generation process model provides a useful guideline when developing and evaluating such systems. The model is used to effectively compare different data analysis systems. Furthermore, the model provides a common language and description of visual analytic processes, which can be used for communication between researchers. At the end, our model reflects areas of research that future researchers can embark on.},

abstract = {Visual analytics supports humans in generating knowledge from large and often complex datasets. Evidence is collected, collated and cross-linked with our existing knowledge. In the process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance. Furthermore, guidelines for the design of uncertainty-aware systems are presented that can aid the user in better decision making.},

A recent trend in visualization is directly embedding user interaction into the visual representations. For example, instead of using control panels to adjust visualization parameters, users can directly adjust basic graphical encodings (e.g., changing distances between points in a scatterplot) to perform similar parameterizations. However, enabling embedded interactions for data visualization requires a strong understanding of how user interactions influence the ability to accurately control and perceive graphical encodings. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of these graphical encodings when serving as the method for interaction. Our user study includes 12 interactive graphical encodings.We discuss the results in terms of task performance and interaction effectiveness metrics.},

One of the reasons of the popularity of linear programming is that it allows to model a large variety of situations with a simple framework. Furthermore, a linear program is relatively easy to solve. The simplex method allows to solve most linear programs efficiently, and the Karmarkar interior-point method allows a more efficient solving of some kinds of linear programming. The power of linear programming is greatly enhanced when came the opportunity of solving integer and mixed integer linear programming. In these models all or some of the decision variables are integers, respectively. In this book we provide a brief introduction to linear programming, together with a set of exercises that introduce some applications of linear programming. We will also provide an introduction to solve linear programming in R. For each problem a possible solution through linear programming is introduced, together with the code to solve it in R and its numerical solution.},

abstract = {Abstract The aim of this study was to identify within-season differences in basketball players' game-related statistics according to team quality and playing time. The sample comprised 5309 records from 198 players in the Spanish professional basketball league (2007–2008). Factor analysis with principal components was applied to the game-related statistics gathered from the official box-scores, which limited the analysis to five factors (free-throws, 2-point field-goals, 3-point field-goals, passes, and errors) and two variables (defensive and offensive rebounds). A two-step cluster analysis classified the teams as stronger (69±8 winning percentage), intermediate (43±5 winning percentage), and weaker teams (32±5 winning percentage); individual players were classified based on playing time as important players (28±4 min) or less important players (16±4 min). Seasonal variation was analysed monthly in eight periods. A mixed linear model was applied to identify the effects of team quality and playing time within the months of the season on the previously identified factors and game-related statistics. No significant effect of season period was observed. A team quality effect was identified, with stronger teams being superior in terms of 2-point field-goals and passes. The weaker teams were the worst at defensive rebounding (stronger teams: 0.17±0.05; intermediate teams: 0.17±0.06; weaker teams: 0.15±0.03; P=0.001). While playing time was significant in almost all variables, errors were the most important factor when contrasting important and less important players, with fewer errors being made by important players. The trends identified can help coaches and players to create performance profiles according to team quality and playing time. However, these performance profiles appear to be independent of season period.},

From left-to-right: layered line chart combining raw and average values, dual-axis layered bar and line chart, brushing and linking in a scatterplot matrix, layered cross-filtering, and an interactive index chart. Abstract—We present Vega-Lite, a high-level grammar that enables rapid specification of interactive data visualizations. Vega-Lite combines a traditional grammar of graphics, providing visual encoding rules and a composition algebra for layered and multi-view displays, with a novel grammar of interaction. Users specify interactive semantics by composing selections. In Vega-Lite, a selection is an abstraction that defines input event processing, points of interest, and a predicate function for inclusion testing. Selections parameterize visual encodings by serving as input data, defining scale extents, or by driving conditional logic. The Vega-Lite compiler automatically synthesizes requisite data flow and event handling logic, which users can override for further customization. In contrast to existing reactive specifications, Vega-Lite selections decompose an interaction design into concise, enumerable semantic units. We evaluate Vega-Lite through a range of examples, demonstrating succinct specification of both customized interaction methods and common techniques such as panning, zooming, and linked selection.},

This has been defined as "the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces" (Thomas and Cook, 2005). Visual analytic environments, therefore, support analytical reasoning using visual representations and interactions, with data representations and transformation capabilities, to support production, presentation, and dissemination. As researchers begin to develop visual analytic environments, it is advantageous to develop metrics and methodologies to help researchers measure the progress of their work and understand the impact their work has on the users who work in such environments. This paper presents five areas or aspects of visual analytic environments that should be considered as metrics and methodologies for evaluation are developed. Evaluation aspects need to include usability, but it is necessary to go beyond basic usability. The areas of situation awareness, collaboration, interaction, creativity, and utility are proposed as the five evaluation areas for initial consideration. The steps that need to be undertaken to develop systematic evaluation methodologies and metrics for visual analytic environments are outlined},

abstract = {Knowledge about visualization tasks plays an important role in choosing or building suitable visual representations to pursue them. Yet, tasks are a multi-faceted concept and it is thus not surprising that the many existing task taxonomies and models all describe different aspects of tasks, depending on what these task descriptions aim to capture. This results in a clear need to bring these different aspects together under the common hood of a general design space of visualization tasks, which we propose in this paper. Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions. We exemplify its concrete use by applying our design space in the domain of climate impact research. To this end, we propose interfaces to our design space for different user roles (developers, authors, and end users) that allow users of different levels of expertise to work with it.},

This expanded data set allows analysts to use unique performance metrics in models to estimate and classify player performance. Instead of grouping players together based on physical attributes and positions played, analysts can group together players that play similar to each other based on these tracked metrics. Existing methods for player classification have typically used offensive metrics for clustering [1]. There have been attempts to classify players using past defensive metrics, but the lack of quality metrics has not produced promising results. The classifications presented in the paper use newly introduced defensive metrics to find different defensive positions for each player. Without knowing the number of categories that players can be cast into, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be applied to find the optimal number of clusters. In the model presented, five different defensive player types can be identified.},

A parallel devel- opment is deep learning predictive approaches that use vast quantities of data with less reliance on feature engineering. This paper applies recurrent neural networks in the form of sequence modeling to predict whether a three-point shot is successful. The models are capable of learning the trajec- tory of a basketball without any knowledge of physics. For comparison, a baseline static machine learning model with a full set of features, such as angle and velocity, in addition to the positional data is also tested. Using a dataset of over 20,000 three pointers from NBA SportVu data, the mod- els based simply on sequential positional data outperform a static feature rich machine learning model in predicting whether a three-point shot is successful. This suggests deep learning models may offer an improvement to traditional feature based machine learning methods for tracking data.},

abstract = {With the growth of the Internet community, textual data has proven to be the main tool of communication in human-machine and human-human interaction. This communication is constantly evolving towards the goal of making it as human and real as possible. One way of humanizing such interaction is to provide a framework that can recognize the emotions present in the communication or the emotions of the involved users in order to enrich user experience. For example, by providing insights to users for personal preferences and automated recommendations based on their emotional state. In this work, we propose a framework for emotion classification in English sentences where emotions are treated as generalized concepts extracted from the sentences. We start by generating an intermediate emotional data representation of a given input sentence based on its syntactic and semantic structure. We then generalize this representation using various ontologies such as Word Net and Concept Net, which results in an emotion seed that we call an emotion recognition rule (ERR). Finally, we use a suite of classifiers to compare the generated ERR with a set of reference ERRs extracted from a training set in a similar fashion. The used classifiers are k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with handcrafted similarity measure, Point Mutual Information (PMI), and PMI with Information Retrieval (PMI-IR). When applied on different datasets, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the existing state-of-the art machine learning and rule-based classifiers with an average F-Score of 84{\%}.},

abstract = {Since the 1970s sociologists have explored the best means for measuring social networks, although few name generator analyses have used sociocentric data or data from developing countries, partly because sociocentric studies in developing countries have been scant. Here, we analyze 12 different name generators used in a sociocentric network study conducted in 75 villages in rural Karnataka, India. Having unusual sociocentric data from a non-Western context allowed us to extend previous name generator research through the unique analyses of network structural measures, an extensive consideration of homophily, and investigation of status difference between egos and alters. We found that domestic interaction questions generated networks that were highly clustered and highly centralized. Similarity between respondents and their nominated contacts was strongest for gender, caste, and religion. We also found that domestic interaction name generators yielded the most homogeneous ties, while advice questions yielded the most heterogeneous. Participants were generally more likely to nominate those of higher social status, although certain questions, such as who participants talk to uncovered more egalitarian relationships, while other name generators elicited the names of social contacts distinctly higher or lower in status than the respondent. Some questions also seemed to uncover networks that were specific to the cultural context, suggesting that network researchers should balance local relevance with global generalizability when choosing name generators.},

abstract = {While you read Foucault's Discipline and Punish, I'd like you to do a few things. 1 . Read with a pen in hand and notepaper by your side. Underline parts that you think may be key statements or summaries of Foucault's position, passages you don't understand, and sections that you might want to return to. Make tables of the oppositions and explanations that Foucault uses (for example, what characterizes the difference between a " terror " and " discipline " society). This workbook should give you some examples of how to do this. I'm asking you to do this in order to practice focusing on the " hot spots " of a big text, the key passages that you (or other critics) might use to ground and signpost their arguments. By making a skeleton of the argument, you'll be able to think more clearly about what points you want to further explore, take issue with, or complicate in your own thought and writing. 2. After you read a section, take stock of the argument's flow. Think about what Foucault argued in the section and what questions he poses that he'll move to explain in the next section. In other words, think of the text as a series of questions and answers, which speak to one another " across the space " of the section breaks. Conceptualizing the text as a dynamic argument, rather than static thesis (a statement that gets said and then insistently repeated, as if reiteration equals persuasion) will be useful when we turn to literary narratives. Novels, and other cultural documents, often pose, wittingly or not, a question or problem that it tries to answer by using the terms or language it initially proposed. Literary narratives " think in print " about social issues and problems. Sometimes they have solutions, other times they run aground. It's this difference that makes reading texts in light of a common problematic interesting. Before you actually read the Foucault section, you might want to review this workbook in order to help notice the argument. But don't take my outline as gospel. Vary the ways in which you use the workbook, sometimes reading it after you read the text, sometimes before. 3. Think of practical examples of what Foucault is arguing. 4. Consider how Foucault's arguments may (or may not) illuminate your own personal experiences and interests. Foucault is writing a history, but he calls it a history of the present. His motive is to look at the past in order to explain our present condition. Does this narrative speak to you as a subject in modern society? Does it feel relevant? If you disagree with Foucault, why did you disagree?},

But voters may also have non-consequentialist (NC) motivations: they may care about how they vote even if it does not affect the outcome. When the likelihood of being pivotal is small, NC motivations can dominate voting behavior. To examine the prevalence of NC motivations, we design an experiment that exogenously varies the probability of being pivotal yet holds constant other features of the decision environment. We find a significant effect, consistent with at least 12.5 percent of subjects being motivated by NC concerns. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@book{Sherma2008,
abstract = {In his regular column in the Sunday Times of India (February 5, 2000) editor Dilip Padgaonkar wrote about his visit to Jakarta to interview the then President of Indonesia Abdur Rahman Wahid. After observing that the public display of Hindu symbols is much more prominent in Jakarta than in Delhi, the capital of India, he referred to the expression 'chatur dharma ek karma' that he noticed engraved on some of the public buildings. Since I had not encountered this expression (or anything else resembling it) in the traditional or modern Indian thought I was naturally intrigued. My efforts to seek additional information about this curious phrase from members belonging to the various academic news groups were fruitless. Finally, I received an explanation (though not quite satisfactory) from Dr Muchlis Hamdi on the H-Asia news group. In the context of Indonesia the expression apparently refers to a military doctrine advocating four actions with one result. '[I]n [the] old regime,' Dr Hamdi explained, '[the] military comprises navy, air force, army, and police. Yet, in [the] present regime, police is separated from [the] military.' At about the same time I happened to broach this subject with Professor Arvind Sharma of the Faculty of Religious Studies, McGill University,Montreal whereupon he mentioned that he had coined the term 'caturdharmya' with a view to determine and bring into discussion the meaning and significance of dharma and its connection with the number four (which routinely figures in such other doctrinal expressions as caturvarnya, caturasrama, caturdhama etc.) in order to refute criticism of the traditional understanding of the four purusarthas leveled by Professor Daya Krishna in Indian Philosophy-A Counter Perspective. In his review of this work Sharma proposes that the numerical value of four in such instances has been used as an arithmetical shorthand for 'many' or 'numerous' or 'plural.' A numeric figure may have been used, he speculates, to compensate for the fact that often a pattern can only be established at the cost of specificity. Thus, the proliferation of jatis extends the doctrine of four varn'as beyond virtual recognition of numerical code for plural or numerous. When seen in this light the doctrine of the four purusarthas seems to make two statements: (1) that people pursue diverse and manifold goals [or religions] in life; and (2) that for certain purposes these goals may be conveniently grouped into four (Sharma 1999). Sharma then goes on to provide a contemporary illustration. In the comparative study of religion the following four religions are typically referred to as religions of Indian origin: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. For the sake of brevity they may be collectively subsumed under the rubric of 'the Indic Religious Tradition.' If one were to use a Sanskrit and Indic idiom to describe this state of affairs, then all of them could be referred to as caturdharmya (hereafter caturdharmya), an expression obviously encompassing the four religions, but also pointing to much more: the Religious Tradition of India as a whole, which is characterized by the four dharmas. It would appear that here Sharma is making a conscious effort to replace the old wooden division of the Indic religious world into the four ways of life each in turn marked by phases which modern scholars often identify by attaching such prefixes as 'proto-,' 'neo-,' or 'revival of-' with a more critical and nuanced understanding of how these traditions are made and sustained in their organic unity. Sharma's novel attempt to bring Indic religions under the canopy of caturdharmya is comparable to a similar development that took place long ago with reference to the concept of sanjiao (Three-in-One Teachings) in China. It is indeed surprising that the composite Indic religious tradition or its history did not produce a pan-Indic, global term of self-reference similar to sanjiao. By contrast, acknowledging the wisdom of the traditional Chinese proverbs, accounts of Chinese religion are usually found organized by the logic of the three teachings of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. An early reference to this organic trinity is attributed to Li Shiqian, a prominent scholar of the sixth century, who wrote that 'Buddhism is the sun, Daoism the moon, and Confucianism the five planets' (Teiser 1996: 3). Li suggests that although they remain separate, the three teachings also coexist as equally indispensable phenomena. Another popular proverb opens by listing the symbols that distinguish the three religions from each other, but closes with the assertion that they are fundamentally the same: 'The three teachings' the gold and cinnabar of Daoism, the relics of Buddhist figures, as well as the Confucian virtues of humanity and righteousness are basically one tradition (Teiser 1996: 3). The concept of caturdharmya, I similarly argue, can stand for the Indic way of life and religiosity, which comprises of a single organic complex of four expressions, each in turn representing a blend of several elements so that as an ensemble it creates a symphony (Dharma) in which the adherents (Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs) participate, whereas the resonance of any one given religion may be compared to a melody (dharma). In my opinion, in coining the felicitous term caturdharmya, Sharma has created a seminal interpretive tool that can ably encapsulate Indic spirituality and religiosity in general besides possibly furnishing a powerful methodological weapon of comparison between Indic religions and philosophies and their Western counterparts. The lens of caturdharmya may also facilitate explanation of religious change and transformation in India. Sharma has argued elsewhere that Indic religions may be distinguished on the basis of the difference in the degrees of acceptance of Vedic authority. Thus, Buddhism and Jainism differ from Hinduism in accepting Vedic authority in the realm of Dharma but not moks'a. At least until 1000, Buddhists did not regard themselves as outside the pale of Hindu society, so far as Dharma was concerned. In support he cites G. C. Pande's remark that the prevailing web of social ritual was substantially unaffected by the distinction of orthodoxy and heterodoxy except in the names of the gods propitiated or the veneration of a given practitioner. In the words of Udayana, the Vedic ritual order form conception to the last rites was performed by all the sects even though they described it as merely empirical (Sharma 1999: 197). In what follows below I argue that Sharma's concept of caturdharmya can, and should be, extended from the field of comparative religion to hermeneutics. Few thinkers remain satisfied with their initial ideas and insights without taking them through different stages of development or without some deepening, change or extension. The consequences, the potential for development, and the manner of unfolding of the initial insight are not clearly foreseen at the beginning. The tendency is to continually renew the initial insight in the light of further development. Often, the initiative may come from others. The present enterprise may be construed as one such attempt at extending the significance of caturdharmya to a hermeneutics of integration as well as differentiation. Such a possibility is already hinted at by Wilhelm Halbfass who observes that Dharma in the sense of ritual pertained to the re-actualization and earthly analogue of the original cosmogonic acts of upholding and holding apart: Whatever the functions of the ritual in Indian historymay have been-its fundamental, though forgotten connection with cosmogony, and its commitment to 'upholding' the space of the world, and to keeping the entities in it apart from each other and in their appropriate identities, is beyond question (Halbfass 1990: 317). The diverse religious, cultural, and social communities (centered on particular ritual practices and customs) that emerged and have flourished in India for millennia can be subsumed, I submit, under a single protean family tree of [Sanatana] Dharma predicated upon the twin strategy of samanvaya (comparable to the category of syncretism) and udaharan'a (comparable to the category of eclecticism (see below). Doxography is a particular form and style of literature which summarizes and classifies the main Indic philosophical schools or systems in a neutral or nonpejorative way and spirit, has had a long tradition in the field of philosophy in India. Bhartr'hari may be regarded as the father of doxography in the Indic tradition. There are, he argued, various views or ways of seeing with reference to one and the same 'tangible' object.1 After affirming that his own guru had studied other systems in addition to his own discipline of Vyakaran'a, Bhartr'hari adds that one's insight gains comprehensiveness from the study of different views (prajna vivekam labhate bhinnair agamadarsanaih (Vakyapadiyam 2: 487'489). This perspective sets that stage for such future doxogrpahic works as: S'addarsanasamuccaya of Haribhadra (700'770), Tattvasamgraha of Santaraks'ita (705'762), and Madhava Vidyaran'ya's Sarvadarsanasamgraha (ca. 1400)(Halbfass 1990: 264'268). A similar perspective sets the stage for what follows below'doxographic exposition of the practical significance of the integrative and differentiating potential of caturdharmya (Dharma) for the followers of the four individual dharmas that evolved in India and their respective communities. Hopefully, the present attempt will generate in turn greater interest among scholars to produce similar doxographic works under the general category of Dharmasamgraha.},

abstract = {Understanding competition is central to the task of strategy formulation and implementation and it is the link between competition and strategy that was explored in the 2011 Dr. Earle F. Zeigler Lecture. It was argued that strategy, given its centrality to organizational phenomena, and strategy research in particular, provides rich and diverse competitive contexts with the potential to reveal some of the unique properties of sport management. To ascertain the prevalence of sport-related strategy research, three sport management journals were subject to content analysis to identify published manuscripts related to strategy. Before presenting the results, the Lecture considered competition on and off the field, the origins of competitive behavior in sport management and a brief review of the major research themes in the generic strategic management literature. Results revealed that 20 (2.5{\%}) of the 805 manuscripts published in the three journals were strategy focused. Research themes and contexts were presented as well as a bibliometric analysis of the reference lists of the 20 identified strategy manuscripts. This analysis highlighted the journals that are influencing published sport management strategy-related research. It was concluded that strategy research specific to sport management has been sparse to date, yet the role of strategy formulation is central to the role of management and should also be central to sport management scholarship.

@article{Shneider2009,
abstract = {In this article I propose the classification of the evolutionary stages that a scientific discipline evolves through and the type of scientists that are the most productive at each stage. I believe that each scientific discipline evolves sequentially through four stages. Scientists at stage one introduce new objects and phenomena as subject matter for a new scientific discipline. To do this they have to introduce a new language adequately describing the subject matter. At stage two, scientists develop a toolbox of methods and techniques for the new discipline. Owing to this advancement in methodology, the spectrum of objects and phenomena that fall into the realm of the new science are further understood at this stage. Most of the specific knowledge is generated at the third stage, at which the highest number of original research publications is generated. The majority of third-stage investigation is based on the initial application of new research methods to objects and/or phenomena. The purpose of the fourth stage is to maintain and pass on scientific knowledge generated during the first three stages. Groundbreaking new discoveries are not made at this stage. However, new ways to present scientific information are generated, and crucial revisions are often made of the role of the discipline within the constantly evolving scientific environment. The very nature of each stage determines the optimal psychological type and modus operandi of the scientist operating within it. Thus, it is not only the talent and devotion of scientists that determines whether they are capable of contributing substantially but, rather, whether they have the 'right type' of talent for the chosen scientific discipline at that time. Understanding the four different evolutionary stages of a scientific discipline might be instrumental for many scientists in optimizing their career path, in addition to being useful in assembling scientific teams, precluding conflicts and maximizing productivity. The proposed model of scientific evolution might also be instrumental for society in organizing and managing the scientific process. No public policy aimed at stimulating the scientific process can be equally beneficial for all four stages. Attempts to apply the same criteria to scientists working on scientific disciplines at different stages of their scientific evolution would be stimulating for one and detrimental for another. In addition, researchers operating at a certain stage of scientific evolution might not possess the mindset adequate to evaluate and stimulate a discipline that is at a different evolutionary stage. This could be the reason for suboptimal implementation of otherwise well-conceived scientific policies.},

abstract = {Every basketball player takes and makes a unique spatial array of shots. In recent years, technology to measure the coordinates of these constellations has made analysis of them possible, and the possibility exists for distinguishing between different shooters at a level of spatial detail finer than the entire basketball court. This paper addresses the challenge of characterizing and visualizing relative spatial shooting effectiveness in basketball by developing metrics to assess spatial variability in shooting. Several global and local measures are introduced and formal tests are pro- posed to enable the comparison of shooting effectiveness between players, groups of players, or other collections of shots. We propose an empirical Bayesian smoothing rate estimate that uses a novel local spatial neighborhood tai- lored for basketball shooting. These measures are evaluated using data from the 2011 to 2012 NBA basketball season in three distinct ways. First we contrast nonspatial and spatial shooting metrics for two players from that season and then extend the comparison to all players attempting at least 250 shots in that season, rating them in terms of shooting effec- tiveness. Second, we identify players shooting significantly better than the NBA average for their shot constellation, and formally compare shooting effectiveness of different players. Third, we demonstrate an approach to map spatial shooting effectiveness. In general, we conclude that these measures are relatively straightforward to calculate with the right input data, and they provide distinctive and useful information about relative shooting ability in basketball. We expect that spatially explicit basketball metrics will be useful additions to the sports analysis toolbox.},

This evaluation framework provides a principled way to make choices about implementation de- tails.

abstract = {When facing a heavily-favored opponent, an underdog must be willing to assume greater-than-average risk. In statistical language, one would say that an underdog must be willing to adopt a strategy whose outcome has a larger-than-average variance. The difficult question is how much risk a team should be willing to accept. This is equivalent to asking how much the team should be willing to sacrifice from its mean score in order to increase the score's variance. In this paper a general, analytical method is developed for addressing this question quantitatively. Under the assumption that every play in a game is statistically independent, both the mean and the variance of a team's offensive output can be described using the binomial distribution. This description allows for direct calculations of the winning probability when a particular strategy is employed, and therefore allows one to calculate optimal offensive strategies. This paper develops this method for calculating optimal strategies exactly and then presents a simple heuristic for determining whether a given strategy should be adopted. A number of interesting and counterintuitive examples are then explored, including the merits of stalling for time, the run/pass/Hail Mary choice in American football, and the correct use of Hack-a-Shaq.},

abstract = {Optimizing the performance of a basketball offense may be viewed as a network problem, wherein each play represents a "pathway" through which the ball and players may move from origin (the in-bounds pass) to goal (the basket). Effective field goal percentages from the resulting shot attempts can be used to characterize the efficiency of each pathway. Inspired by recent discussions of the "price of anarchy" in traffic networks, this paper makes a formal analogy between a basketball offense and a simplified traffic network. The analysis suggests that there may be a significant difference between taking the highest-percentage shot each time down the court and playing the most efficient possible game. There may also be an analogue of Braess's Paradox in basketball, such that removing a key player from a team can result in the improvement of the team's offensive efficiency.},

We suggest a way by which this data set, when coupled with a network-style model of the offense that relates players' skills to the team's success at running different plays, can be used to automatically learn players' skills and predict the performance of untested 5-man lineups in a way that accounts for the interaction between players' respective skill sets. After developing a general analysis procedure, we present as an example a specific implementation of our method using a simplified network model. While player tracking data is not yet available in the public domain, we evaluate our model using simulated data and show that player skills can be accurately inferred by a simple statistical inference scheme. Finally, we use the model to analyze games from the 2011 playoff series between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Oklahoma City Thunder and we show that, even with a very limited data set, the model can consistently describe a player's interactions with a given lineup based only on his performance with a different lineup.},

abstract = {The advent of the Internet, with sophisticated algorithmic search engines, has made accessing information as easy as lifting a finger. No longer do we have to make costly efforts to find the things we want. We can "Google" the old classmate, find articles online, or look up the actor who was on the tip of our tongue. The results of four studies suggest that when faced with difficult questions, people are primed to think about computers and that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself and enhanced recall instead for where to access it. The Internet has become a primary form of external or transactive memory, where information is stored collectively outside ourselves.},

abstract = {Undertaking philosophically hermeneutic research requires embodying the fundamental hermeneutic notions espoused by Heidegger, Gadamer, and other related philosophers. For both supervisors and students, there is "a way" of working that infuses a hermeneutic project with a particular kind of contemplative openness. In this article, I will draw from my own experience of coming to appreciate the nature of this approach. Reading Gadamer challenged me to see that, before interpreting the meanings inherent in research data, I first needed to grapple with the fact that I brought ready-made prejudices to the interpretation. Further, and perhaps more importantly, was the recognition that while prejudices may have a negative influence, they could also bring a positive view. Just as I needed to understand key Gadamerian notions to shed light on the interpretive nature of philosophical hermeneutics, I will unpack these to underpin the ongoing discussion of hermeneutic research strategies. In articulating "how" to be hermeneutic, I explain how I guide students embarking on hermeneutic research. Discussion centres on surfacing and engaging with preunderstandings through 'presuppositions interviewing', journalling and the careful selection of words that refine and crystallise meanings in ways that reflectively and reflexively engage and expand horizons of understanding. In this article, I use examples from my own experience as a doctoral student and supervisor of doctoral students to assist other supervisors and students understand both the importance of "being hermeneutic" and ways of achieving robust and philosophically congruent hermeneutic research.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the semantic Web and Linked Data. The classic World Wide Web is built upon the idea of setting hyperlinks between Web documents. These hyperlinks are the basis for navigating and crawling the Web.Technologically, the core idea of Linked Data is to use HTTP URLs not only to identify Web documents, but also to identify arbitrary real world entities.Data about these entities is represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Whenever a Web client resolves one of these URLs, the corresponding Web server provides an RDF/ XML or RDFa description of the identified entity. These descriptions can contain links to entities described by other data sources.The Web of Linked Data can be seen as an additional layer that is tightly interwoven with the classic document Web. The author mentions the application of Linked Data in media, publications, life sciences, geographic data, user-generated content, and cross-domain data sources. The paper concludes by stating that the Web has succeeded as a single global information space that has dramatically changed the way we use information, disrupted business models, and led to profound societal change.},

abstract = {Research on trust in e-commerce typically views trust as an important condition of successful commercial exchange. It aims to identify relevant factors of trust and establish how these influence potential buyers' decisions to interact with vendors. The aim is to provide ways of increasing trust. This paper questions the validity of this traditional approach to trust in e-commerce. It criticizes the fact that the concept of trust which underlies mainstream e-commerce trust research is too narrow to be of use, particularly because it neglects important aspects of human relations such as morality and ethics. Using the theoretical lens of Critical theory, the paper argues that mainstream trust research in information systems displays signs of ideology, commodification, and reification with regards to trust and thus treats trust as a fetish. In order to support this assertion, the paper describes a critical discourse analysis of some of the leading publications on e-commerce trust which supports the Critical contention. The paper concludes that Critical theory has a valuable contribution to make to e-commerce trust research. Taking the argument serious, however, cannot lead to a simple incorporation of some of the Critical aspects into e- commerce trust research. Instead, it requires researchers to fundamentally rethink their understanding of research and the role of research in society. Key},

They make ingredients and relations explicit, guide thinking processes of the designer or scientist, and support communications, often across the boundaries of disciplines. In the fields of cognitive psychology and human-machine interaction, block diagrams have been a dominant means for representing cognitive systems. However, we believe that this form of representation may constrain how we think about cognition in undesirable ways. This form of representation biases viewers to see cognition as a sequential, step-by-step process, under emphasizing the dynamical properties of closed-loop, adaptive processes. Block diagrams emphasize activity and internal mental operations (awareness) and occlude the ecological or work domain (situational) constraints},

This study contributes to emerging research on the nature of social media use by revealing the motivations underpinning the desire of fans to communicate on the Facebook sites of several National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. Our findings indicate that fans exercise four key motives as they draw value from the social media enabled connection to the team: passion, hope, esteem and camaraderie. Further, and in light of our understanding of these motives, we identify how this platform can be used to facilitate interaction, a key construct in relationship marketing. A content analysis, using a netnographic methodology, was undertaken to explore online comments by fans of eight purposefully selected NBA teams over a two-week period during the off-season. This period represents strong potential for isolating highly identified fans who are motivated to seek engagement and interaction. Implications for sport managers to further relational goals are identified.},

We tested whether the amount teams spent for players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) influenced how much playing time players got and how long they stayed with NBA franchises. Sunk costs were operationalized by the order in which players were selected in the college draft. Draft order was then used to predict playing time, being traded, and survival in the NBA. Although one might logically expect that teams play and keep their most productive players, we found significant sunk-cost effects on each of these important personnel decisions. Results showed that teams granted more playing time to their most highly drafted players and retained them longer, even after controlling for players' on-court performance, injuries, trade status, and position played. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for both sunk-cost research and the broader literature on managerial decision making.

He received a diploma in mechanical engineering from the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg, Berlin, in 1906, after which he did several years of research on aeronautics before turning to the full-time study of logic and philosophy. Hertz, Boltzmann, Mach, Weininger, and William James, all important influences on Wittgenstein, are authors whose work was both philosophical and scientific. The relationship between everyday life, science, and philosophy, is a central concern throughout the course of his writing. He regarded philosophy, properly conducted, as an autonomous activity, a matter of clarifying our understanding of language, or investigating grammar. Wittgenstein thought philosophy should state the obvious as a way of disabusing us of the desire to formulate philosophical theories of meaning, knowledge, language, or science, and was deeply opposed to the naturalist view that philosophy is a form of science. In his later work, Wittgenstein rejected systematic approaches to understanding language and knowledge. Wittgenstein's answer to the Socratic question about the nature of knowledge is that it has no nature, no essence, and so it is a mistake to think one can give a single systematic answer: If I was asked what knowledge is, I would list items of knowledge and add “and suchlike.” There is no common element to be found in all of them, because there isn't one.

As remnants of active textual engagement, doodles bring into higher relief the reciprocity of linguistic production and visual conception, the correspondence of scribal techniques and graphic illustration, and the psychically charged vacillation between readership and authorship. The drawings, illustrations, and paintings considered in this essay lie at the intersection of humanist visual and literary culture in the years surrounding the publication of The Praise of Folly and suggest the powerful identification these erudite men felt toward the figure of Folly, as an exemplar of sorts. Read alongside formal portraits Erasmus commissioned to construct an extra-textual ‘public' face, the scholar's travestied autographs shadowed and prefigured his self-promotional machinations. As a patron and promoter of portraiture, Erasmus valued art's ability to rewrite the autonomous body as a social intertext, a visual corollary of the emulative circuitry of humanist rhetorical practices. However, as the humorlessness of the Luther-bloc radicalized reformatory rhetoric, iconoclastic and censorial fury – the dark side of doodling – turned against the image of Erasmus in word and image, undercutting hopes for moderate church reform.},

This paper critically examines models of sport consumption by undertaking a comparative analysis of the major works completed to the present time.

They are often constrained by an overemphasis on social-psychological traits, and give only limited attention to the cultural and economic context in which behaviors take place. Moreover, they rarely explain how fans might move between different segments, or how relationships with sport teams are formed in the first place.

abstract = {The scientific discipline, as the primary unit of internal differentiation of science, is an invention of nineteenth century society. There exists a long semantic prehistory of disciplina as a term for the ordering of knowledge for purposes of instruction in schools and universities. But only the nineteenth century established real disciplinary communication systems. They are based on specialization of scientists, role differentiation in the organizations of science, the emergence of standard forms of scientific publication, and the rise of the research imperative which demands an incessant search for novelties. All these structural changes coalesce in the disciplinary community as a new type of communication system in science. After that the discipline functions as unit of structure formation in the social system of science, in systems of higher education, as a subject domain for teaching and learning in schools, and finally, as a designation of occupational and professional roles. Although the processes of differentiation in science have been going on ever since, the scientific discipline as a basic unit of structure formation is stabilized by these plural roles in different functional contexts of modern society. Finally, the individual discipline is embedded in an internal environment of other disciplines. The continuous mutual observation and interaction of these disciplines is the most important factor in the dynamics of modern science.},

Both measurements are imprecise, the former overestimates turnout, the latter either underestimates or overestimates turnout. In this article, I introduce a more accurate calculation of macro-level electoral participation into the comparative turnout literature, the percentage of eligible voters or VEP turnout. To do so, I first calculate VEP turnout and add it to a dataset on electoral turnout that covers more than 500 elections conducted in democracies from 1990 to 2012. Second, I use a standard turnout model and highlight that the constituents of turnout somewhat differ across RV turnout, VAP turnout, and VEP turnout. Keywords},

Typically, however, there is a considerable gap between the scope of the formal model of grammar employed for deriving referential evidence and its implementation. While accounting for many subtleties of language, such formal models at most par- tially address the algorithmic aspects of referential processing. This paper investigates the issue of implementing syntactic disjoint reference for robust anaphor resolution. An algorithmic account of binding condition verification will be developed that, on one hand, captures the theoretical subtleties, and, on the other hand, exhibits computational efficiency and fulfils the robust- ness requirements. Taking as input the potentially fragmentary parses of a robust state-of-the-art parser, the practical performance of this algorithm will be evaluated with respect to the task of anaphor resolution and shown to be nearly optimal.},

In-depth interviews were undertaken with 16 fans categorized into two groups, fans (n = 9) and super fans, members of organized groups (n = 7). The interview protocol was semi-struc- tured. Thematic coding was employed, which is designed to enhance comparability between plural groups. The findings indicated that cultural and individual meanings were transferred to the team brand and fans linked the meanings through their own rituals, which shaped psychological ownership and fan identity. Moreover, this paper contributes to sport management scholarship by indicating that psychological ownership is conceptually different to team identification},

abstract = {The birth and decline of disciplines are critical to science and society. How do scientific disciplines emerge? No quantitative model to date allows us to validate competing theories on the different roles of endogenous processes, such as social collaborations, and exogenous events, such as scientific discoveries. Here we propose an agent-based model in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by social interactions among agents representing scientists. Disciplines emerge from splitting and merging of social communities in a collaboration network. We find that this social model can account for a number of stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, scholars, and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science. While several "science of science" theories exist, this is the first account for the emergence of disciplines that is validated on the basis of empirical data.},

We present a map of Finnish science based on unsupervised-learning classification, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach vis-{\`{a}}-vis those generated byhumanreasoning. We conclude that from theoretical and practical perspec- tives there exist several challenges forhumanreasoning- based classification frameworks of scientific knowledge, as they typically try to fit new-to-the-world knowledge into historical models of scientific knowledge, and cannot easily be deployed for new large-scale data sets. Automated classification schemes, in contrast, generate classification models only from the available text corpus, thereby identifying credibly novel bodies of knowledge. They also lend themselves to versatile large-scale data analysis, and enable a range of Big Data possibilities. However, we also argue that it is neither possible nor fruitful to declare one or another method a superior approach in terms of realism to classify scientific knowl- edge, andwebelieve that the merits of each approach are dependent on the practical objectives of analysis.

abstract = {In 1908, Francis Galton discussed anecdotal data he had collected for the compilation of a 'beauty-map of the British Isles'. Based on his discussion, the present study attempted to compile a more empirical beauty-map of London. A community sample of 461 Londoners completed a questionnaire in which they rated the physical attractiveness of women and men in London's 33 boroughs, as well as their familiarity with those boroughs. Results showed a significant interaction between borough and rated sex, with women being rated as more attractive across boroughs, and three boroughs in particular (the City of London, the City of Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea) being rated high in physical attractiveness. Overall, ratings of attractiveness were significantly positively correlated with familiarity of boroughs, as well as objective measures of borough affluence (specifically, annual gross pay and average house prices) but not of borough health (life expectancy). These results are discussed in relation to the association between wealth and attractiveness, as well as Galton's original beauty-map. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fig. 1. We performed three experiments to measure color difference perceptions for visualizations, focusing on diagonally symmetric marks from scatterplots, elongated marks from bar charts, and asymmetric elongated marks from line graphs. The tested size ranges are shown above for two greens at ∆E = 10 (figures have been scaled to 30{\%} of the tested size). We confirm prior findings that perceived color difference varies inversely with size and find that elongated marks provide significantly greater discriminability for encoding designers. Our results provide probabilistic models of color difference for visualization. Abstract—Color is frequently used to encode values in visualizations. For color encodings to be effective, the mapping between colors and values must preserve important differences in the data. However, most guidelines for effective color choice in visualization are based on either color perceptions measured using large, uniform fields in optimal viewing environments or on qualitative intuitions. These limitations may cause data misinterpretation in visualizations, which frequently use small, elongated marks. Our goal is to develop quantitative metrics to help people use color more effectively in visualizations. We present a series of crowdsourced studies measuring color difference perceptions for three common mark types: points, bars, and lines. Our results indicate that peoples' abilities to perceive color differences varies significantly across mark types. Probabilistic models constructed from the resulting data can provide objective guidance for designers, allowing them to anticipate viewer perceptions in order to inform effective encoding design.},

abstract = {Ensemble coding supports rapid extraction of visual statistics about distributed visual information. Researchers typically study this ability with the goal of drawing conclusions about how such coding extracts information from natural scenes. Here we argue that a second domain can serve as another strong inspiration for understanding ensemble coding: graphs, maps, and other visual presentations of data. Data visualizations allow observers to leverage their ability to perform visual ensemble statistics on distributions of spatial or featural visual information to estimate actual statistics on data. We survey the types of visual statistical tasks that occur within data visualizations across everyday examples, such as scatterplots, and more specialized images, such as weather maps or depictions of patterns in text. We divide these tasks into four categories: identification of sets of values, summarization across those values, segmentation of collections, and estimation of structure. We point to unanswered questions for each category and give examples of such cross-pollination in the current literature. Increased collaboration between the data visualization and perceptual psychology research communities can inspire new solutions to challenges in visualization while simultaneously exposing unsolved problems in perception research.},

In this paper, we examine whether local franchise characteristics are associated with the consumption of goods that are produced by other franchises within the same league. Specifically, we investigate how uncertainty over whether the local market team reaches the postseason affects interest in out-of-market National Football League broadcasts. We find that consumers possess a conditional interest in other league contests depending on the degree to which the local franchise is in the race to reach the playoffs. This effect increases at a diminishing rate and reaches a maximum when local franchise playoff probability is approximately 60 {\%}. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Both compared a visual analytics approach using parallel coordinates with a machine-learning approach using information theory. Both found that the visual analytics approach had some advantages over the machine learning approach, especially when sparse datasets were used as the ground truth. We examine various possible factors that may have contributed to such advantages, and collect empirical evidence for supporting the observation and reasoning of these factors. We propose an information-theoretic model as a common theoretic basis to explain the phenomena exhibited in these two case studies. Together we provide interconnected empirical and theoretical evidence to support the usefulness of visual analytics.},

abstract = {Conditional decision markets concurrently predict the future and decide on it. These markets price the impact of decisions, conditional on them being executed. After the markets close, a principal decides which decisions are executed based on the prices in the markets. As some decisions are not executed, the respective outcome cannot be observed, and the markets predicting the impact of non-executed decisions are void. This allows ex-post costless manipulation of such markets. We conduct two versions of an online experiment to explore scenarios in which a principal runs conditional decision markets to inform her choice among a set of a risky alternatives. We find that the level of manipulation depends on the simplicity of the market setting. When a trader is alone, has the power to move prices far enough, and the decision is deterministically tied to market prices or a very high correlation between prices and decision is implied, only then manipulation occurs. As soon as another trader is present to add risk to manipulation, manipulation is eliminated. Our results contrast theoretical work on conditional decision markets in two ways: First, our results suggest that manipulation may not be as meaningful an issue. Second, probabilistic decision rules are used to add risk to manipulation; when manipulation is not a meaningful issue, deterministic decisions provide the better decision with less noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental analysis isolating the effects of the conditional nature of decision markets.},

abstract = {Evaluating the overall ability of players in the National Hockey League (NHL) is a difficult task. Existing methods such as the famous "plus/minus" statistic have many shortcomings. Standard linear regression methods work well when player substitutions are relatively uncommon and scoring events are relatively common, such as in basketball, but as neither of these conditions exists for hockey, we use an approach that embraces the unique characteristics of the sport. We model the scoring rate for each team as its own semi-Markov process, with hazard functions for each process that depend on the players on the ice. This method yields offensive and defensive player ability ratings which take into account quality of teammates and opponents, the game situation, and other desired factors, that themselves have a meaningful interpretation in terms of game outcomes. Additionally, since the number of parameters in this model can be quite large, we make use of two different shrinkage methods depending on the question of interest: full Bayesian hierarchical models that partially pool parameters according to player position, and penalized maximum likelihood estimation to select a smaller number of parameters that stand out as being substantially different from average. We apply the model to all five-on-five (full-strength) situations for games in five NHL seasons.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the creation of visual mementos as a new application area for visualization. We define visual mementos as visualizations of personally relevant data for the purpose of reminiscing, and sharing of life experiences. Today more people collect digital information about their life than ever before. The shift from physical to digital archives poses new challenges and opportunities for self-reflection and self-representation. Drawing on research on autobiographical memory and on the role of artifacts in reminiscing, we identified design challenges for visual mementos: mapping data to evoke familiarity, expressing subjectivity, and obscuring sensitive details for sharing. Visual mementos can make use of the known strengths of visualization in revealing patterns to show the familiar instead of the unexpected, and extend representational mappings beyond the objective to include the more subjective. To understand whether people's subjective views on their past can be reflected in a visual representation, we developed, deployed and studied a technology probe that exemplifies our concept of visual mementos. Our results show how reminiscing has been supported and reveal promising new directions for self-reflection and sharing through visual mementos of personal experiences.},

abstract = {Concept selection is recognized as a crucial component of the design process that largely involves informal group discussions within design teams. However, little is known about what factors affect the selection or filtering of creative ideas during this process. This is problematic because in order for innovation to occur, individuals must first identify and select the creative con- cepts developed in the early stages of design. However, prior research has shown that individuals tend to select conventional alternatives during this process due to the inherent risk associated with creative concepts. Therefore, the current study was developed to understand how per- sonality traits, risk attitudes, and idea generation abilities impact the promotion or filtering of creative ideas in a team setting. The results from our empirical study with engi- neering students reveal that teams who have higher levels of conscientiousness, agreeableness, and tolerance for ambiguity are more prone to select novel concepts. In addition, the results revealed that the teams who generate creative ideas did not necessarily select creative ideas during concept selection. These results add to our under- standing of team-based decision making during concept selection and allow us to provide guidelines for increasing the flow of creative ideas through this process.},

Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency.

On video on-demand (VOD) services, this has recently been referred to as “binge watching”, where poten- tially entire seasons of TV shows are consumed in a single viewing session. While a user viewership model may reveal this binging behavior, creating an accurate model has several challenges, in- cluding censored data, deviations in the population, and the need to consider external influences on consumption habits. In this pa- per, we introduce a novel statistical mixture model that incorpo- rates these factors and presents a “first of its kind” characterization of viewer consumption behavior using a real-world dataset that in- cludes playback data from a VOD service. From our modeling, we tackle various predictive tasks to infer the consumption decisions of a user in a viewing session, including estimating the number of episodes they watch and classifying if they continue watching an- other episode. Using these insights, we then identify binge watch- ing sessions based on deviation from normal viewing behavior. We observe different types of binging behavior, that binge watchers of- ten viewcertain content out-of-order, and that bingewatching is not a consistent behavior among our users. These insights and our find- ings have application in VOD revenue generation, consumer health applications, and customer retention analysis. Keywords},

abstract = {The success of a country's elite sport success tends to be concentrated on specific sports or specific events. Additionally, as the predictive value of macro-level factors (e.g. population and GDP) for success decreases, the management of elite sport systems becomes more important. Even though multiple authors developed frame- works referring to common characteristics of these systems, little is known about the organizational development in specific sports and the allocation of resources to elite development. According to the resource-based view (RBV), management strategy is a function of organizations' resources and the efficiency in which these resources are structured and combined in higher-order capabilities. This article identifies organiza- tional resources and first-order capabilities in the development of a competitive advantage in elite athletics. Based on a literature review and 34 interviews with national coaches and high-performance directors, 98 resources and first-order capabil- ities were categorized according to the nine policy pillars of the SPLISS (Sport Policy factors Leading to International Sporting Success) model. Although this list encom- passes key resources for a competitive advantage, there remains a diversity of ways to combine and configure these resources in higher-order capabilities. As countries represent a diverse configuration of these resources, further empirical research is necessary to explore and assess countries' core capabilities and competitive position in elite athletics},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a model in which fans team attachment is the determinant of three sponsorship outcomes: sponsor image, purchase intentions, and word of mouth. Furthermore, following the sponsorship literature, the role of sport fans involvement on the development of team attachment was examined. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaires were collected from fans of a professional basketball team in Greece (n 14 354). Structural equation modeling was employed in order to test the model fit and estimate the model coefficients. Findings The findings supported the premise that highly attached fans are more likely to develop positive image for their team sponsor, exhibit higher intentions for purchasing and recommending the sponsors products. Research limitations/implications The proposed model on sport sponsorship outcomes was supported. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of the role of team attachment and sponsor image in predicting sponsorship outcomes. Practical implications The findings from this research have practical implications for both sport team marketers and sponsors. Both parties need to have a good understanding of how and when sponsorship works to maximize its value. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of sport involvement, team attachment, sponsor image, purchase intentions, and word of mouth within an integrated sponsorship model, and the testing of their interrelations. While these variables have been used in the sponsorship literature before, they have not been empirically tested in an integrated model.},

abstract = {Annual draft systems are the principal method used by teams in major sporting leagues to recruit amateur players. These draft systems frequently take one of three forms: a lottery style draft, a weighted draft, or a reverse-order draft. Reverse-order drafts can create incentives for teams to deliberately under-perform, or tank, due to the perceived gain from obtaining quality players at higher draft picks. This paper uses a dynamic simulation model that captures the key components of a win-maximising sporting league, including the amateur player draft, draft choice error, player productivity, and between-team competition, to explore how competitive balance and incentives to under-perform vary according to league characteristics. We find reverse-order drafts can lead to some teams cycling between success and failure and to other teams being stuck in mid-ranking positions for extended periods of time. We also find that an incentive for teams to tank exists, but that this incentive decreases (i) as uncertainty in the ability to determine quality players in the draft increases, (ii) as the number of teams in the league reduces, (iii) as team size decreases, and (iv) as the number of teams adopting a tanking strategy increases. Simulation models can be used to explore complex stochastic dynamic systems such as sports leagues, where managers face difficult decisions regarding the structure of their league and the desire to maintain competitive balance.},

Mainstream theories of decision making tend to be strongly normative and based on wishfully unrealistic “idealized” modeling. In order to develop theories of actual decision making under uncertainty, we need new methodologies that account for how human (sentient) actors often manage uncertain situations “well enough.” Some possibly helpful methodologies, drawing on digital science, focus on the role of emotions in determining people's choices; others examine how people construct narratives that enable them to act; still others combine qualitative with quantitative data.},

Political liberals, but not relatively more conservative participants, were more likely to endorse consequen- tialism when the victim had a stereotypically White American name than when the victim had a stereotypically Black American name. Study 2 found evidence suggesting participants believe that the moral principles they are endorsing are general in nature: when presented sequentially with both versions of the scenario, liberals again showed a bias in their judgments to the initial scenario, but demonstrated consistency thereafter. Study 3 found conservatives were more likely to endorse the unintended killing of innocent civilians when Iraqis civilians were killed than when Americans civilians were killed, while liberals showed no significant effect. In Study 4, participants primed with patriotism were more likely to endorse consequentialism when Iraqi civilians were killed by American forces than were participants primed with multiculturalism. However, this was not the case when American civilians were killed by Iraqi forces. Implications for the role of reason in moral judgment are discussed. Keywords:},

For instance, when searching for a conjunction of two features, we are able to select a feature-marked subset (e.g., all items sharing same color) prior to focusing attention on particular items. Standard models assume that only separate features can guide attention since they are only available at the preattentive stage of visual analysis and no conjunction information is available at that stage. Here I show that search performance is affected by both the distribution offeatures across the visual field and their conjunctions in particular items. It appears that people are unable to use “pure”, unbound features for selecting relevant subsets. This major finding requires reconsidering the standard models of guided search. The concept of distributed attention, which represents multiple items as imperfectly bound objects, seems promising in explaining this finding.},

This makes them especially useful for the rapid visual categorization of multiple objects of different types that are intermixed in space. Rapid categorization implies our ability to judge at one brief glance whether all visible objects represent different types or just variants of one type. A framework presented here states that processes resembling statistical tests can underlie that categorization. At an early stage (primary categorization), when independent ensemble properties are distributed along a single sensory dimension, the shape of that distribution is tested in order to establish whether all features can be represented by a single or multiple peaks. When primary categories are separated, the visual system either reiterates the shape test to recognize subcategories (in-depth processing) or implements mean comparison tests to match several primary categories along a new dimension. Rapid categorization is not free from processing limitations; the role of selective attention in categorization is discussed in light of these limitations.},

abstract = {We investigate priming and anchoring effects on perceptual tasks in visualization. Priming or anchoring effects depict the phenomena that a stimulus might influence subsequent human judgments on a perceptual level, or on a cognitive level by providing a frame of reference. Using visual class separability in scatterplots as an example task, we performed a set of five studies to investigate the potential existence of priming and anchoring effects. Our findings show that—under certain circumstances—such effects indeed exist. In other words, humans judge class separability of the same scatterplot differently depending on the scatterplot(s) they have seen before. These findings inform future work on better understanding and more accurately modeling human perception of visual patterns.},

We consider snapshots of the network as points in high-dimensional space and project these to two dimensions for visualization and interaction using two juxtaposed views: one for showing a snapshot and one for showing the evolution of the network. With this approach users are enabled to detect stable states, recurring states, outlier topologies, and gain knowledge about the transitions between states and the network evolution in general. The components of our approach are discretization, vectorization and normalization, dimensionality reduction, and visualization and interaction, which are discussed in detail. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by applying it to artificial and real-world dynamic networks.},

In order to make good choices, an understanding of the purpose and meaning of visualization is needed. Especially, it would be nice if we could assess what a good visualization is. In this paper an attempt is made to determine the value of visualization. A technological viewpoint is adopted, where the value of visualization is measured based on effectiveness and efficiency. An economic model of visualization is presented, and benefits and costs are established. Next, consequences (brand limitations of visualization are discussed (including the use of alternative methods, high initial costs, subjective/less, and the role of interaction), as well as examples of the use of the model for the judgement of existing classes of methods and understanding why they are or are not used in practice. Furthermore, two alternative views on visualization are presented and discussed: viewing visualization as an art or as a scientific discipline. Implications and future directions are identified.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Its originality is twofold. First, it examines a corpus of reports covering 18 years of international climate negotiations, a dataset never explored before through digital techniques. This corpus is particularly interesting because it provides the most consistent and detailed reporting of the negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Second, in this paper we test an original approach to text analysis that combines automatic extractions and manual selection of the key issue-terms. Through this mixed approach, we tried to obtain relevant findings without imposing them on our corpus. The originality of our corpus and of our approach encouraged us to question some of the habits of digital research and confront three common misunderstandings about digital methods that we discuss in the first part of the article (section ‘Three misunderstandings on digital methods in social sciences'). In addition to reflecting on methodology, however, we also wanted to offer some substantial contribution to the understanding of UN-framed climate diplomacy. In the second part of the article (section ‘Three maps on climate negotiations') we will therefore introduce some of the preliminary results of our analysis. By discussing three visualizations, we will analyze the thematic articulation of the climatic negotiations, the rise and fall of these themes over time and the visibility of different countries in the debate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n [1]: {\#}aff-1$\backslash$n [2]: {\#}aff-2$\backslash$n [3]: {\#}aff-3},

Striving to make the intricacy of scientific debate readable for a larger public, controversy mapping is trapped in a classic simplicity/complexity trade-­‐off: how to respect the richness of controversies without designing maps too complicated to be useful? Having worked on the question for almost two years in a project bringing together social scientists and designers (emapsproject.com 1), we can now propose a way out of this contradiction and suggest three ways of moving through the simplicity/complexity continuum. The first movement-­‐by multiplying the number of maps and by taking into account users before the beginning and after the end of the design process-­‐ allows to bypass the simplicity/complexity trade-­‐off. The second movement bind together narration and exploration and allows the publics to venture in the maze of controversies unraveling the story that will guide them out. The third movement allows to involve the publics through all the phases of a cartographic campaign and to engage it again and again.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the differences and affinities among three types of networks (namely Actor-Networks, Social Networks and Digital Networks) that are playing an increasingly important role in digital STS. In the last few decades, the notion of networks has slowly but steadily struck root across broad strands of STS research. It started with the advent of actor-network theory, which provided a convenient instrument to describe the construction work of socio-technical phenomena. Then came network analysis, and scholars who imported into STS the techniques of investigation and visualization developed in the tradition of social network analysis and scientometrics. Finally, with the increasing 'computerization' of STS, scholars turned their attention to digital networks as a way of tracing collective life. Many researchers (not least at the Sciences Po m{\'{e}}dialab) have more or less explicitly tried to link these three movements in one coherent set of digital methods, betting on the idea that actor-network theory can be operationalized through network analysis thanks to the data provided by digital networks (Venturini 2012a/b). Yet, to be honest, little proves the continuity among these three objects besides the homonymy of the word 'network'. Are we sure that we are talking about the same thing?

In a world of risk ("small world"), all alternatives, consequences, and probabilities are known. In uncertain ("large") worlds, some of this information is unknown or unknowable. Most of cognitive neuroscience studies exclusively study the neural correlates for decisions under risk (e.g., lotteries), with the tacit implication that understanding these would lead to an understanding of decision making in general. First, we show that normative strategies for decisions under risk do not generalize to uncertain worlds, where simple heuristics are often the more accurate strategies. Second, we argue that the cognitive processes for making decisions in a world of risk are not the same as those for dealing with uncertainty. Because situations with known risks are the exception rather than the rule in human evolution, it is unlikely that our brains are adapted to them. We therefore suggest a paradigm shift toward studying decision processes in uncertain worlds and provide first examples.},

abstract = {We present a methodology for generating a plausible simulation of a basketball match between two distinct teams as a sequence of team-level play-by-play in-game events. The methodology facilitates simple inclusion into any expert system and decision-making process that requires the performance evaluation of teams under various scenarios. Simulations are generated using a random walk through a state space whose states represent the in-game events of interest. The main idea of our approach is to extend the state description to capture the current context in the progression of a game. Apart from the in-game event label, the extended state description also includes game time, the points difference, and the opposing teams' characteristics. By doing so, the model's transition probabilities become conditional on a broader game context (and not solely on the current in-game event), which brings several advantages: it provides a means to infer the teams' specific behavior in relation to their characteristics, and to mitigate the intrinsic non-homogeneity of the progression of a basketball game (which is especially evident near the end of the game). To simplify the modeling of the transition distribution, we factorize it into terms that can be estimated with separate models. We applied the presented methodology to three seasons of National Basketball Association (NBA) games. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of forecasting accuracy and in terms of the plausibility of the generated simulations.},

If owners are win-maximizing sportsmen instead, then revenue sharing can lead to increased competitive balance and higher payrolls. Evidence of the sportsman effect is provided by erosion of monopsonistic exploitation in the four major American sports leagues where players now share about 60{\%} of revenues. Monopsony power erosion forces sports-league cartels to exploit statutory monopoly power in monster deals for media rights fees and public venue subsidies. New evidence on competitive balance suggests that revenue sharing leads to increased balance with or without team salary caps.

abstract = {Despite being the most successful women's league in history, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) has faced challenges ranging from summer sport league placement to ownership issues. The most immediate concern though, is whether WNBA owners and NBA executives will continue to justify their investments in this financially wavering enterprise. This article is intended to contribute to the debate over the WNBA from a sustainability perspective. We further argue that corporate social responsibility (CSR) could be one of the underpinning elements to guide executive decision-making about the WNBA. We suggest that sustainability can be transposed beyond the “business case” for the WNBA by highlighting three forms of capital (i.e., economic, cultural, and social) that could be less polarized for the WNBA then for their male counterparts. Finally, we offer a CSR perspective for the WNBA arguing that it could be viewed as a strategic investment for the NBA.},

abstract = {From the 1970s onwards, a wide range of forecasting techniques have been developed in the literature on electoral forecasting. However, these models have primarily been applied in two-party, presidential democracies, with the US being by far the most popular country to investigate. The question thus arises whether the same techniques that have proved successful in this context can also be applied to the more complex, multiparty democracies in northern Europe. This paper seeks to answer this question and in the process makes two main contributions. Firstly, the popular dynamic linear model (Jackman, 2005) is tried and tested in Germany and Sweden where it is shown that reasonable forecasts can be made despite the complexity of the systems and the emergence of new parties. A novelty is then introduced when cyclical changes in party support are modelled through a seasonal component. This extension of the dynamic linear model helps to significantly lower the error in early forecasts and is thus something that could be useful in future applications of the model.},

abstract = {In 7 free-recall experiments, the benefit of creating drawings of to-be-remembered information relative to writing was examined as a mnemonic strategy. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were presented with a list of words and were asked to either draw or write out each. Drawn words were better recalled than written. Experiments 3-5 showed that the memory boost provided by drawing could not be explained by elaborative encoding (deep level of processing, LoP), visual imagery, or picture superiority, respectively. In Experiment 6, we explored potential limitations of the drawing effect, by reducing encoding time and increasing list length. Drawing, relative to writing, still benefited memory despite these constraints. In Experiment 7, the drawing effect was significant even when encoding trial types were compared in pure lists between participants, inconsistent with a distinctiveness account. Together these experiments indicate that drawing enhances memory relative to writing, across settings, instructions, and alternate encoding strategies, both within- and between-participants, and that a deep LoP, visual imagery, or picture superiority, alone or collectively, are not sufficient to explain the observed effect. We propose that drawing improves memory by encouraging a seamless integration of semantic, visual, and motor aspects of a memory trace.},

This facilitates detailed analyses of player movement patterns. In this paper, we focus on the difficult problem of offensive playcall classification. While outstanding individual players are crucial for the success of a team, the strategies that a team can execute and their understanding of the opposing team's strategies also greatly influence game outcomes. These strategies often involve complex interactions between players. We apply techniques from machine learning to directly process SportVU tracking data, specifically variants of neural networks. Our system can label as many sequences with the correct playcall given roughly double the data a human expert needs with high precision, but takes only a fraction of the time. We also show that the system can achieve good recognition rates when trained on one season and tested on the next. 1.},

abstract = {This paper aims to explore how social-and self-factors may affect consumers' brand loyalty while they follow companies' microblogs. Drawing upon the commitment-trust theory, social influence theory, and self-congruence theory, we propose that network externalities, social norms, and self-congruence are the key determinants in the research model. The impacts of these factors on brand loyalty will be mediated by brand trust and brand commitment. We empirically test the model through an online survey on an existing microblogging site. The findings illustrate that network externalities and self-congruence can positively affect brand trust, which subsequently leads to brand commitment and brand loyalty. Meanwhile, social norms, together with self-congruence, directly posit influence on brand commitment. Brand commitment is then positively associated with brand loyalty. We believe that the findings of this research can contribute to the literature. We offer new insights regarding how consumers' brand loyalty develops from the two social-factors and their self-congruence with the brand. Company managers could also apply our findings to strengthen their relationship marketing with consumers on microblogging sites.},

abstract = {User generated content on Twitter (produced at an enormous rate of 340 million tweets per day) provides a rich source for gleaning people's emotions, which is necessary for deeper understanding of people's behaviors and actions. Extant studies on emotion identification lack comprehensive coverage of "emotional situations" because they use relatively small training datasets. To overcome this bottleneck, we have automatically created a large emotion-labeled dataset (of about 2.5 million tweets) by harnessing emotion-related hash tags available in the tweets. We have applied two different machine learning algorithms for emotion identification, to study the effectiveness of various feature combinations as well as the effect of the size of the training data on the emotion identification task. Our experiments demonstrate that a combination of unigrams, big rams, sentiment/emotion-bearing words, and parts-of-speech information is most effective for gleaning emotions. The highest accuracy (65.57{\%}) is achieved with a training data containing about 2 million tweets.},

abstract = {Node-link diagrams provide an intuitive way to explore networks and have inspired a large number of automated graph layout strategies that optimize aesthetic criteria. However, any particular drawing approach cannot fully satisfy all these criteria simultaneously, producing drawings with visual ambiguities that can impede the understanding of network structure. To bring attention to these potentially problematic areas present in the drawing, this paper presents a technique that highlights common types of visual ambiguities: ambiguous spatial relationships between nodes and edges, visual overlap between community structures, and ambiguity in edge bundling and metanodes. Metrics, including newly proposed metrics for abnormal edge lengths, visual overlap in community structures and node/edge aggregation, are proposed to quantify areas of ambiguity in the drawing. These metrics and others are then displayed using a heatmap-based visualization that provides visual feedback to developers of graph drawing and visualization approaches, allowing them to quickly identify misleading areas. The novel metrics and the heatmap-based visualization allow a user to explore ambiguities in graph layouts frommultiple perspectives in order to make reasonable graph layout choices. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through case studies and expert reviews},

abstract = {The goal of the sports brand is to create meaningful associations with fans that connect with their core values. A strong sports brand allows the consumer to incorporate the team into their day-to-day activities (Couvelaere {\&} Richelieu, 2005, p. 25). Arvidsson (2006) suggests that consumers create brand value through their shared experiences with the brand and through an emotional connection to the brand through social identification. A strong relationship between the sport team and its fans leads the fan to engage in behaviors that support the team (Fisher {\&} Wakefield, 1998). Social media and mobile apps are changing the way marketers approach their branding strategies (Simmons, 2007). Professional sport brands are developing online branding strategies to convert casual fans to highly identified fans (Ioakamidis, 2010). Online social networks specifically for sport allow for increased levels of fan engagement and fan loyalty, which is necessary to meet relationship-marketing goals. The present study provides an empirical analysis of the SIBE model. The SIBE model is a largely a conceptual work, with only one study testing the model (Boyle {\&} Magnusson, 2007); this study explores the relationships between each individual component as well as testing a comprehensive model. Additionally, this project incorporates the use of social media into the model to further understanding of its use in increasing sport team brand equity. Social media allows sports fans the opportunity to engage with other fans and the team, publicly display their identification with the team, and feel connected to the team despite separation from the team geographically. Finally, this study assesses the influence of brand relationships and brand experience on customer-based brand equity. The role of brand relationships and experience on customer-based brand equity will be evaluated through consumer interaction with social media. The microblogging site Twitter and mobile apps are studied to determine if user involvement with social media influences brand relationships and brand experience.},

In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry.

We perform a large-scale study of human wayfinding, in which, given a network of links between the concepts of Wikipedia, people play a game of finding a short path from a given start to a given target concept by following hyperlinks. What distinguishes our setup from other studies of human Web-browsing behavior is that in our case people navigate a graph of connections between concepts, and that the exact goal of the navigation is known ahead of time. We study more than 30,000 goal-directed human search paths and identify strategies people use when navigating information spaces. We find that human wayfinding, while mostly very efficient, differs from shortest paths in characteristic ways. Most subjects navigate through high-degree hubs in the early phase, while their search is guided by content features thereafter. We also observe a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency: conceptually simple solutions are more common but tend to be less efficient than more complex ones. Finally, we consider the task of predicting the target a user is trying to reach. We design a model and an efficient learning algorithm. Such predictive models of human wayfinding can be applied in intelligent browsing interfaces.},

abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

Wittgenstein went beyond relativism by making explicit universal anthropological categories that are specified differently in different cultures. The 2nd answer lies in H.-G. Gadamer's (1967) historical hermeneutics. By introducing the concepts of tradition and fusion of horizons, Gadamer evades both absolutism and relativism. The 3rd answer is developed by J. Habermas (1981) in his critical hermeneutics. By situating communicative action in the life-world, and stressing the possibility of discussion and critique, Habermas can ascertain that there is no absolute truth without having to surrender to relativism.},

The proposed combined model consisted of 12 items with four measures of motivation (i.e., information, entertainment, pass time, and fanship) and 12 items with four measures of constraints (i.e., accessibility, economic, skills, social). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with a convenience sample of 1,124 respondents was employed to analyze the conceptual framework and elements of the scale. Motivations for STC among the respondents were positively and significantly related, whereas constraints were negatively and significandy related to their Twitter consumption in regard to following athletes.

Using experimental data as well as responses from the 2000 and 2004 American National Election Studies, the authors first consider whether personality affects the activation of emotional response. Next, they explore the degree to which citizen attitudes like openness to information and compromise are explained by personality characteristics and subconscious emotional response. Finally, they consider the implications of these results for our normative understanding of democratic citizenship. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2007 American Academy of Political and Social Science},

These decisions often involve both domain and visualization design expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process that impedes exploration. In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures. We describe Voyager's architecture, motivating design principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization specification tool, we find that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance rapid exploration and targeted question-answering.},

abstract = {In basketball, knowing the odds of success of a shot is criti- cal. Many factors affect shot success, including the location of the shot, the shot style (e.g., jump shot, finger roll, dunk), and of course the player's skill. Crucially, the list of high- probability shots is different for each player. We predict the success of shot made by NBA basketball players in the 2015-2016 season, and show that using traditional methods such as logistic regression or support vector machine regres- sion is problematic because many style-location-player com- binations do not occur in the training data, i.e., the data are highly sparse. Hence, we propose a shot recommender system based on factorization machines. Factorization ma- chines have been used successfully in recommendation prob- lems because they handle sparse data, scale well to very large datasets, and provide latent factors that capture un- derlying rater (player) preferences and item (shot) features. For the NBA player data, a 25-factor model predicts log- odds of shot success with high accuracy. It also identifies both highly recommended shots and shots to be avoided, in- cluding shots that are not represented in the training data.},

Our modeling demonstrates that ratings changes attributable to scoring margin are essentially simi- lar in neutral and losing markets, but different than winning markets. Implications related to the NFL's policy on televising uncompetitive games in neutral markets are further examined, concluding that the relationship between final scoring margin and audience interest is nuanced.},

abstract = {Data exploration requires forming analysis goals, planning actions and evaluating results effectively, all of which are complex cogni-tive activities. Therefore, the data exploration and analysis process can be improved through a principled and comprehensive ap-proach to analyzing the cognitive activities of the user given a data exploration tool. However, many taxonomies and evaluations focus on a specific tool or specific design guides instead of cogni-tive activities comprehensively. In this paper, we first present the Cognitive Exploration Framework that identifies six stages of cognitive activities in visual data exploration. These stages are a combination of two activities—planning and assessing—across data analysis, interaction, and visualization. Cognitive barriers in each stage can lower the success and speed of data exploration. The framework also identifies the factors of decision-making, existing knowledge and motivation that influence cognitive activi-ties. We argue that cognitive stages can be supported by improv-ing the design of tools rather than their computing capabilities. We demonstrate how the framework clarifies the structured rela-tionship between design guides to specific cognitive stages. In particular, the framework can also be used to guide evaluation of data exploration tools. To reveal cognitive barriers in each stage, we focused on the failures instead of success stories, and on moti-vating self-driven open-ended exploration instead of using benchmarked tasks on fixed datasets. With these goals, we studied short-term casual use of an exploratory tool by novices with lim-ited training. Our results reveal cognitive barriers across all stag-es. We also discuss directions for future research and applications.},

@article{Yu2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Data flow systems allow the user to design a flow diagram that specifies the relations between system components which process, filter or visually present the data. Visualization systems may benefit from user-defined data flows as an analysis typically consists of rendering multiple plots on demand and performing different types of interactive queries across coordinated views. In this paper, we propose VisFlow, a web-based visualization framework for tabular data that employs a specific type of data flow model called the subset flow model. VisFlow focuses on interactive queries within the data flow, overcoming the limitation of interactivity from past computational data flow systems. In particular, VisFlow applies embedded visualizations and supports interactive selections, brushing and linking within a visualization-oriented data flow. The model requires all data transmitted by the flow to be a data item subset (i.e. groups of table rows) of some original input table, so that rendering properties can be assigned to the subset unambiguously for tracking and comparison. VisFlow features the analysis flexibility of a flow diagram, and at the same time reduces the diagram complexity and improves usability. We demonstrate the capability of VisFlow on two case studies with domain experts on real-world datasets showing that VisFlow is capable of accomplishing a considerable set of visualization and analysis tasks. The VisFlow system is available as open source on GitHub.},

@article{Yuan2015,
abstract = {Predicting the outcome of a single sporting event is difficult; predicting all of the outcomes for an entire tournament is a monumental challenge. Despite the difficulties, millions of people compete each year to forecast the outcome of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, which spans 63 games over 3 weeks. Statistical prediction of game outcomes involves a multitude of possible covariates and information sources, large performance variations from game to game, and a scarcity of detailed historical data. In this paper, we present the results of a team of modelers working together to forecast the 2014 NCAA men's basketball tournament. We present not only the methods and data used, but also several novel ideas for post-processing statistical forecasts and decontaminating data sources. In particular, we highlight the difficulties in using publicly available data and suggest techniques for improving their relevance.},

@article{Zaharia2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc. The growth of sport sponsorship has led to an increase in the number of studies measuring sponsorship outcomes in different sport settings. Most studies, however, have focused on understanding the factors leading to purchase intentions. A more accurate assessment of sponsorship effectiveness would come through measuring actual purchase behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine a sport sponsorship model that included awareness, fit, attitude toward the sponsor, past purchases, purchase intentions, and actual purchases. Data were collected via longitudinal web surveys conducted with soccer fans from the United States. The results of a structural equation model provided evidence that the relationships among the analyzed sponsorship outcomes did not have a significant effect on actual purchase behaviors. The discussion includes questions about the impact of sponsorship variables such as awareness, fit, attitude toward the sponsor, purchase intentions, and past purchases on actual purchase behaviors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.User-authored annotations of data can support analysts in the activity of hypothesis generation and sensemaking, where it is not only critical to document key observations, but also to communicate insights between analysts. We present annotation graphs, a dynamic graph visualization that enables meta-analysis of data based on user-authored annotations. The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature. We develop and evaluate the system through an iterative user-centered design process with three experts, situated in the domain of analyzing HCI experiment data. The results suggest that annotation graphs are effective as a method of visually extending user-authored annotations to data meta-analysis for discovery and organization of ideas.},

abstract = {We study the problemof learning cohesive, fine-grained mod- els of player motion. For instance, agents often choose mo- tion sequences with long-term goals in mind, such as achiev- ing a certain strategic position. Conventional policy learning approaches, such as those based on Markov decision pro- cesses, generally fail at learning cohesive long-term behavior in such high-dimensional state spaces, and are only effective when myopic planning leads to the desired behavior. The key difficulty is that such approaches use “shallow” planners that only learn a single state-action policy. We instead pro- pose to learn a hierarchical planner that reasons about both long-term and short-term goals, which we instantiate as a hi- erarchical deep memory network. We showcase our approach in a case study on modeling basketball player trajectories, and show that it generates significantly more realistic tra- jectories compared to non-hierarchical baselines as judged by professional sports analysts.},

@techreport{Zumel2016,
abstract = {Cleaning and preparing data makes up a substantial portion of the time and effort spent in a data science project—the majority of the effort, in many cases. It can be tempting to shortcut this process and dive right into the modeling step without looking very hard at the data set first, especially when you have a lot of data. Resist the temptation. No data set is perfect; you will be missing data, have misinterpreted data, or have incorrect data. Some data fields will be dirty and inconsistent. If you don't take the time to examine the data before you start to model, you may find yourself redoing your work repeatedly as you discover bad data fields or variables that need to be transformed before modeling. In the worst case, you'll build a model that returns incorrect predictions—and you won't be sure why. By addressing data issues early, you can save yourself some unnecessary work, and a lot of headaches! In this paper, we'll demonstrate some of the things that can go wrong with data, and explore ways to address those issues using the R statistical language (https://cran.r-project.org/) before going on to analysis. For faster numerical libraries, we will use the Microsoft R Open distribution (https://mran.microsoft.com/open/). Throughout this discussion, we will keep an idealized goal in mind: using machine learning to build a predictive model.},
